It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be recognized as a resource, strength, and benefit.\nDiversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, national origin, language, cultural heritage, physical ability, neurodiversity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and socio-economic class. Each of these varied, and often intersecting, identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives we bring to this class, to this department, and to the greater EEB community. We will work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.\nWe expect that everybody in this class will respect each other, and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other people’s perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from their own. Racist, sexist, colonialist, homophobic, transphobic, and other abusive and discriminatory behavior and language will not be tolerated in this class and will result in disciplinary action, such as removal from class session or revocation of group working privileges. Please consult the University of Toronto Code of Student Conduct for details on unacceptable conduct and possible sanctions.\nPlease let us know if something said or done in this class, by either a member of the teaching team or other students, is particularly troubling or causes discomfort or offense. While our intention may not be to cause discomfort or offense, the impact of what happens throughout the course is not to be ignored and is something that we consider to be very important and deserving of attention. If and when this occurs, there are several ways to alleviate some of the discomfort or hurt you may experience:\n\nDiscuss the situation privately with a member of the teaching team. We are always open to listening to students’ experiences, and want to work with students to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue.\nNotify us of the issue through another source such as a trusted faculty member or a peer. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing the issue directly with us, we encourage you to seek out another, more comfortable avenue to address the issue.\nContact the Anti-Racism and Cultural Diversity Office to report an incident and receive complaint resolution support, which may include consultations and referrals.\n\nWe acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a community that increasingly embraces these core values. Your suggestions and feedback are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.",

She studies the genome of a weedy plant to better understand how transposable elements affect sex chromosome evolution. She taught herself how to use R during her honours thesis and fell in love because it was much kinder than Lisp or C++ and, most importantly, because aesthetics. Zoë makes plots from aggressively large genomic data sets and spends a lot of time literally bash-ing her data into a file small enough for her computer to load into RStudio.

When you launch RStudio, you will see four panels. Starting at the top left and going clockwise, these panels are:\n\nThe text editor panel. This is where we can write scripts, i.e. putting several commands of code together and saving them as a text document so that they are accessible for later and so that we can execute them all at once by running the script instead of typing them in one by one.\nThe environment panel, which shows us all the files and objects we currently loaded into R.\nThe files-plots-help panel. This panel shows the files in the current directory (the folder we are working out of), any plots we make later, and also documentation for various packages and functions. Here, the documentation is formatted in a way that is easier to read and also provides links to the related sections.\nThe console is another space we can input code, only now the code is executed immediately and doesn’t get saved at the end.\n\nTo change the appearance of your RStudio, navigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Appearance. You can change the font and size, and the editor theme. The default is “Textmate”, but if you like dark mode, a good option is “Tomorrow Night Bright”. You can also change how your panels are organized.\nIn the RStudio interface, we will be writing code in a format called the R Notebook. As the name entails, this interface works like a notebook for code, as it allows us to save notes about what the code is doing, the code itself, and any output we get, such as plots and tables, all together in the same document.\nWhen we are in the Notebook, the text we write is normal plain text, just as if we would be writing it in a text document. If we want to execute some R code, we need to insert a code chunk.\nYou insert a code chunk by either clicking the “Insert” button or pressing Ctrl/Command + Alt + i simultaneously. You could also type out the surrounding backticks, but this would take longer. To run a code chunk, you press the green arrow, or Ctrl/Command + Shift + Enter.\n\n1+2\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAs you can see, the output appears right under the code block.\nThis is a great way to perform explore your data, since you can do your analysis and write comments and conclusions right under it all in the same document. A powerful feature of this workflow is that there is no extra time needed for code documentation and note-taking, since you’re doing your analyses and taking notes at the same time. This makes it great for both taking notes at lectures and to have as a reference when you return to your code in the future.",

    "text": "R Markdown\nThe text format we are using in the R Notebook is called R Markdown. This format allows us to combine R code with the Markdown text format, which enables the use of certain characters to specify headings, bullet points, quotations and even citations. A simple example of how to write in Markdown is to use a single asterisk or underscore to emphasize text (*emphasis*) and two asterisks or underscores to strongly emphasize text (**strong emphasis**). When we convert our R Markdown text to other file formats, these will show up as italics and bold typeface, respectively. If you have used WhatsApp, you might already be familiar with this style of writing. In case you haven’t seen it before, you have just learned something about WhatsApp in your quantitative methods class…\nTo learn more about R Markdown, check out this reference.\n\nSaving data and generating reports\nTo save our notes, code, and graphs, all we have to do is to save the R Notebook file, and the we can open it in RStudio next time again. However, if we want someone else to look at this, we can’t always just send them the R Notebook file, because they might not have RStudio installed. Another great feature of R Notebooks is that it is really easy to export them to HTML, Microsoft Word, or PDF documents with figures and professional typesetting. There are actually many academic papers that are written entirely in this format and it is great for assignments and reports. (You might even use it to communicate with your collaborators!) Since R Notebook files convert to HTML, it is also easy to publish simple and good-looking websites in it, in which code chunks are embedded nicely within the text.\nLet’s try to create a document in R.\nFirst, let’s set up the YAML block. This is found at the top of your document, and it is where you specify the title of your document, what kind of output you want, etc.\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your title here\"\nauthor: \"Your name here\"\ndate: \"Insert date\"\noutput:\n  pdf_document: default\n---\n\nNext, let’s type code to perform the calculation we did above:\n\n1+2\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nTo create the output document, we say that we “knit” our R Markdown file into, e.g., a PDF. Simply press the Knit button here and the new document will be created.\nAs you can see in the knitted document, the title showed up as we would expect, and lines with pound sign(s) in front of them were converted into headers. Most importantly, we can see both the code and its output! Plots are generated directly in the report without us having to cut and paste images! If we change something in the code, we don’t have to find the new images and paste it in again, the correct one will appear right in your code.\nWhen you quit, R will ask you if you want to save the workspace (that is, all of the variables you have defined in this session); in general, you should say “no” to avoid clutter and unintentional confusion of results from different sessions. Note: When you say “yes” to saving your workspace, it is saved in a hidden file named .RData. By default, when you open a new R session in the same directory, this workspace is loaded and a message informing you so is printed: [Previously saved workspace restored]. It is often best practice to turn this feature off completely.",

Groups will test predictions borne out of their hypotheses with reproducible and quantitative analysis techniques (e.g., ANOVA). If your group has an idea for statistical analyses that are beyond the scope of the course, please let us know. We are happy to support any groups who want to learn new tools, but expect that these groups are ready to learn how these tools work on their own; we hope to equip you with enough understanding to learn new things independently. Finally, the work must be original – while we may be repurposing data, we will not be simply redoing analyses. Keep in mind also that any work you do as part of this course may not be submitted for credit in another course (such as a fourth-year research project) and vice versa. While you may not submit your work for this course for credit in another course, you are welcome to publish or present your work in an academic setting. (In fact, if you do so, please let us know!)\nA note about community/citizen science websites: since the data is community-controlled, it may not always be research quality. There may be incorrect species IDs, inaccurate geolocations or time of observations, or discrepancies in protocols. When working with community science data, make sure that the data is cleaned and wrangled so that it is reliable.

    "text": "Option 2: Modeling\nGroups will develop a mathematical model to answer a question in ecology and/or evolution they find interesting. There are many reasons to develop models: they help clarify assumptions, generate predictions, nullify hypotheses, provide mechanistic explanations for observed data, and help us know what kinds of data to look for. New models almost always build on existing and well-studied ones (e.g., the Lotka-Volterra model). The fact models are simplifying representations of the real world is by design! The goal of building a model is to identify the key features that make a process interesting, represent the process mathematically (and, in doing so, clarify what assumptions are being made!), characterize the behaviour of the model, and from this characterization draw conclusions about how the process being modelled works. Characterization of a model can involve mathematical analysis, simulation, and confrontation with data.\nThe key steps in this project are to 1) identify an interesting question in ecology or evolution, 2) develop (and likely revise) a model to address that question, 3) characterize the behaviour of the model, and 4) draw biological conclusions from the model and its characterization.\nIf you are interested in modeling, let Mete and Zoë know as soon possible!",
