    "text": "1.2 Course Overview\nThis course covers statistical and data analysis, reproducible quantitative methods, and scientific computing in R to answer questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. Statistical and data analysis, modeling, and computing are essential skills for all biologists. This course is designed to meet a growing demand for reproducible, openly accessible, analytically thorough, and well-documented science. Students will learn to analyze and visualize data, develop mathematical models, and document their research using the R programming language. No prerequisite programming experience is required.\nPrerequisites: BIO220H1 and one of EEB225H1, STA288H1, or STA220H1\n\n1.2.1 Time\nTue and Thu 2:10 - 4:00 PM EST.\n\n\n1.2.2 Class Locations\nRW109 (Ramsay Wright first floor computer lab), St. George Campus.\n\n\n\nOffice hours (in EST)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMete\nWeds 11-12pm\nESC3044\n\n\nVicki\nMon 11-12pm\nESC3044\n\n\nZoe\nThurs 4-5pm\nRW109\n\n\nJessie\nTues 4-5pm\nRW109\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Contact protocol\nPlease address all course-related and project issues to both Vicki and Mete, with the exception that questions regarding assignments should be addressed to Zoe and Jessie.

    "text": "1.3 Diversity and inclusion statement\nAs students, you all have something unique and special to offer to science. It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be recognized as a resource, strength, and benefit.\nDiversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, national origin, language, cultural heritage, physical ability, neurodiversity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and socio-economic class. Each of these varied, and often intersecting, identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives we bring to this class, to this department, and to the greater EEB community. We will work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.\nWe expect that everybody in this class will respect each other, and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other people’s perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from their own. Racist, sexist, colonialist, homophobic, transphobic, and other abusive and discriminatory behavior and language will not be tolerated in this class and will result in disciplinary action, such as removal from class session or revocation of group working privileges. Please consult the University of Toronto Code of Student Conduct for details on unacceptable conduct and possible sanctions.\nPlease let us know if something said or done in this class, by either a member of the teaching team or other students, is particularly troubling or causes discomfort or offense. While our intention may not be to cause discomfort or offense, the impact of what happens throughout the course is not to be ignored and is something that we consider to be very important and deserving of attention. If and when this occurs, there are several ways to alleviate some of the discomfort or hurt you may experience:\n\nDiscuss the situation privately with a member of the teaching team. We are always open to listening to students’ experiences, and want to work with students to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue.\nNotify us of the issue through another source such as a trusted faculty member or a peer. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing the issue directly with us, we encourage you to seek out another, more comfortable avenue to address the issue.\nContact the Anti-Racism and Cultural Diversity Office to report an incident and receive complaint resolution support, which may include consultations and referrals.\n\nWe acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a community that increasingly embraces these core values. Your suggestions and feedback are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.",

Assignments will be handed out on Thursdays after class and are due at 8:00 PM on the following Thursday.\nThe Challenge Assignment is equivalent to a take home exam. The format will be the same as the other assignments, but this assignment is designed challenge you to go a little beyond what was taught in class. It will be distributed on 9:00 AM on Nov 13, and it will be due 11:59 PM on Nov 17. Students are welcome to work in a group on this assignment, but each student must submit their own original work. No extensions will be granted on this assignment except under the same extra-ordinary circumstances akin to those under which an exam might be deferred. We only expect you to do your best!\nAs per our stance on supporting student’s mental health, we are happy to accommodate a 72-hour extension for one of the assignments, no questions asked. Otherwise, except under extenuating circumstances, there will be a penalty of 5% per day (including weekends) for all late submissions.
