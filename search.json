She runs a research group studying the dynamics and evolution of human infectious diseases within patients and across populations. Her team develops mathematical, statistical, and computational models to predict disease trajectories and help design interventions. Before moving to U of T, she was faculty at Johns Hopkins, and did her graduate and post-graduate training at Harvard. Coding is still her favourite part of her job, and she has used R - along with other programming languages - for many large open-source computational projects focusing on diseases such as COVID-19, HIV, RSV, and the opioid crisis.\n\n\nTeaching assistants\nJessie Wang\nJessie is a 4th year PhD student in the Frederickson lab at UTSG. She studies plant-microbe interactions using high- throughput experimentation in duckweeds. She fell in love with R during her time as an undergraduate and took EEB313 in 2020, simultaneously sharpening her coding skills while conducting research alone in the lab. Jessie loves to spend too much money on fancy coffee as she types away, making sure her code is well-annotated and her figures look beautiful. Outside of work, she enjoys caring for her many houseplants and aquariums, finding new delicious eats, and admiring other people’s pets.\nErik Curtis\nErik is a 2nd year PhD student interested in the epidemiology and population ecology of Pacific salmon, as well as the ecology of infectious diseases. In his PhD research, he is investigating the prevalence of co-infection in juvenile salmon. He’s also using eDNA metabarcoding to examine the coastal marine community concurrent with juvenile salmon migration and salmon farm activity. Prior to joining the MK lab, he studied at the University of Notre Dame, majoring in Biology and Math, where he examined the fate and transport of eDNA in experimental streams. \n\n\nContacts\nFor scientific/technical questions on the content of course material in lectures or on assignments, please email TAs Jessie (jae.wang@mail.utoronto.ca) and Erik (erik.curtis@mail.utoronto.ca).

Otherwise, late assignments will face a penalty of 50% per day.\nThe Challenge Assignment is equivalent to a take home exam. The format will be the same as the other assignments, but this assignment is designed challenge you to go a little beyond what was taught in class. It will be distributed on 9:00 AM on Mar 6, and it will be due 11:59 PM on Mar 11. Students should work on their own and submit their own original work. No extensions will be granted on this assignment except under the same extra-ordinary circumstances akin to those under which an exam might be deferred. We only expect you to do your best!\nThe project will be conducted as a group and groups will receive a single grade (except in exceptional circumstances). No late assignments will be accepted for any component of the group project.\nAll submissions to Quercus/GitHub must be submitted as PDFs (i.e., knitted).\n\n\n\nPre-requisites and preparation",

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to attend and participate in all classes. If you are experiencing symptoms or suspect you have a communicable disease but decide to come to class, please practice hand hygiene and wear a face mask. \n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nYou should be aware of the University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters; all suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in there. Also see How Not to Plagiarize. Notably, it is NOT appropriate to use large sections from internet sources, and inserting a few words here and there does not make it an original piece of writing. Be careful in using internet sources – most online material are not reviewed and there are many errors out there. Make sure you read material from many sources (published, peer-reviewed, trusted internet sources) and that you write an original text using this information. Always cite your sources. In case of doubt about plagiarism, talk to your instructors and TAs. Please make sure that what you submit for the final project does not overlap with what you submit for other classes, such as the 4th-year research project. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic behaviour or appropriate research and citation methods, please reach out to me.\n\n\nOn the use of generative AI\nWe recognize that there are emerging generative artificial intelligence tools that can not only help with syntax and errors, but can write code de novo given text prompts. While these tools can be extremely useful when used responsibly by experienced coders, we believe it is critical to understand the foundational principles and syntax of programming by generating your own code, from scratch. Thus, we do not permit students to submit work generated by chat-bot programs, and will investigate suspicions of such use according to existing procedures for academic dishonesty. Students should be prepared to discuss, justify, and recreate any of their submitted work if prompted by course instructors at any time. Towards the end of the class, we will discuss the promise and pitfalls of such tools and experiment with their use for applications discussed in the course.\n\n\nOnline Communication\nAll communication regarding the course should be done through Quercus or using your mail.utoronto.ca email address. Please post questions that may be relevant to other students in the Discussions section of the course website, instead of asking the instructor by email\n\n\nAccessibility needs\nIf you require accommodations for a disability, or have any accessibility concerns about the course or course materials, please notify the course instructor, or contact Accessibility Services, as soon as possible regarding accommodations.\n\n\nDiversity and inclusion statement\nAs students, you all have something unique and special to offer to science. It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be recognized as a resource, strength, and benefit.\nDiversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, national origin, language, cultural heritage, physical ability, neurodiversity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and socio-economic class. Each of these varied, and often intersecting, identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives we bring to this class, to this department, and to the greater EEB community. We will work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.\nWe expect that everybody in this class will respect each other, and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other people’s perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from their own. Racist, sexist, colonialist, homophobic, transphobic, and other abusive and discriminatory behavior and language will not be tolerated in this class and will result in disciplinary action, such as removal from class session or revocation of group working privileges. Please consult the University of Toronto Code of Student Conduct for details on unacceptable conduct and possible sanctions.\nPlease let us know if something said or done in this class, by either a member of the teaching team or other students, is particularly troubling or causes discomfort or offense. While our intention may not be to cause discomfort or offense, the impact of what happens throughout the course is not to be ignored and is something that we consider to be very important and deserving of attention. If and when this occurs, there are several ways to alleviate some of the discomfort or hurt you may experience:\n\nDiscuss the situation privately with a member of the teaching team. We are always open to listening to students’ experiences, and want to work with students to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue.\nNotify us of the issue through another source such as a trusted faculty member or a peer. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing the issue directly with us, we encourage you to seek out another, more comfortable avenue to address the issue.\nContact the Anti-Racism and Cultural Diversity Office to report an incident and receive complaint resolution support, which may include consultations and referrals.\n\nWe acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a community that increasingly embraces these core values. Your suggestions and feedback are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.\n\n\nWellness statement\nWe on the teaching team value your health and wellness. In order to succeed in this class, in university, and beyond, you must balance your work with rest, exercise, and attention to your mental and physical health. Working until exhaustion is NOT a badge of honor. If you are finding it difficult to balance your health and well-being with your work in this class, please do not hesitate to let us know. We are happy to help connect you with resources and services on campus and also to make accommodations to our course plan as needed. Our inboxes are always open, and we are also available for virtual chats by appointment. You have our support, and we believe in you.",

    "text": "1.2 RStudio and the R Notebook\nRStudio includes the R console, but also many other convenient functionalities, which makes it easier to get started and to work with R. When you launch RStudio, you will see four panels. Starting at the top left and going clockwise, these panels are:\n\nThe text editor panel. This is where we can write scripts, i.e. putting several commands of code together and saving them as a text document so that they are accessible for later and so that we can execute them all at once by running the script instead of typing them in one by one.\nThe environment panel, which shows us all the files and objects we currently loaded into R.\nThe files-plots-help panel. This panel shows the files in the current directory (the folder we are working out of), any plots we make later, and also documentation for various packages and functions. Here, the documentation is formatted in a way that is easier to read and also provides links to the related sections.\nThe console is another space we can input code, only now the code is executed immediately and doesn’t get saved at the end.\n\nTo change the appearance of your RStudio, navigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Appearance. You can change the font and size, and the editor theme. The default is “Textmate”, but if you like dark mode, a good option is “Tomorrow Night Bright”. You can also change how your panels are organized.\nIn the RStudio interface, we will be writing code in a format called the R Notebook. As the name entails, this interface works like a notebook for code, as it allows us to save notes about what the code is doing, the code itself, and any output we get, such as plots and tables, all together in the same document.\nWhen we are in the Notebook, the text we write is normal plain text, just as if we would be writing it in a text document. If we want to execute some R code, we need to insert a code chunk.\nYou insert a code chunk by either clicking the “Insert” button or pressing Ctrl/Command + Alt + i simultaneously. You could also type out the surrounding backticks, but this would take longer. To run a code chunk, you press the green arrow, or Ctrl/Command + Shift + Enter.\n\n1+2\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAs you can see, the output appears right under the code block.\nThis is a great way to perform explore your data, since you can do your analysis and write comments and conclusions right under it all in the same document. A powerful feature of this workflow is that there is no extra time needed for code documentation and note-taking, since you’re doing your analyses and taking notes at the same time. This makes it great for both taking notes at lectures and to have as a reference when you return to your code in the future.",

    "text": "1.3 R Markdown\nThe text format we are using in the R Notebook is called R Markdown. This format allows us to combine R code with the Markdown text format, which enables the use of certain characters to specify headings, bullet points, quotations and even citations. A simple example of how to write in Markdown is to use a single asterisk or underscore to emphasize text (*emphasis*) and two asterisks or underscores to strongly emphasize text (**strong emphasis**). When we convert our R Markdown text to other file formats, these will show up as italics and bold typeface, respectively. If you have used WhatsApp, you might already be familiar with this style of writing. In case you haven’t seen it before, you have just learned something about WhatsApp in your quantitative methods class…\nTo learn more about R Markdown, check out this reference.\n\n1.3.1 Saving data and generating reports\nTo save our notes, code, and graphs, all we have to do is to save the R Notebook file, and the we can open it in RStudio next time again. However, if we want someone else to look at this, we can’t always just send them the R Notebook file, because they might not have RStudio installed. Another great feature of R Notebooks is that it is really easy to export them to HTML, Microsoft Word, or PDF documents with figures and professional typesetting. There are actually many academic papers that are written entirely in this format and it is great for assignments and reports. (You might even use it to communicate with your collaborators!) Since R Notebook files convert to HTML, it is also easy to publish simple and good-looking websites in it, in which code chunks are embedded nicely within the text.\nLet’s try to create a document in R.\nFirst, let’s set up the YAML block. This is found at the top of your document, and it is where you specify the title of your document, what kind of output you want, etc.\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your title here\"\nauthor: \"Your name here\"\ndate: \"Insert date\"\noutput:\n  pdf_document: default\n---\n\nNext, let’s type code to perform the calculation we did above:\n\n1+2\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nTo create the output document, we say that we “knit” our R Markdown file into, e.g., a PDF. Simply press the Knit button here and the new document will be created.\nAs you can see in the knitted document, the title showed up as we would expect, and lines with pound sign(s) in front of them were converted into headers. Most importantly, we can see both the code and its output! Plots are generated directly in the report without us having to cut and paste images! If we change something in the code, we don’t have to find the new images and paste it in again, the correct one will appear right in your code.\nWhen you quit, R will ask you if you want to save the workspace (that is, all of the variables you have defined in this session); in general, you should say “no” to avoid clutter and unintentional confusion of results from different sessions. Note: When you say “yes” to saving your workspace, it is saved in a hidden file named .RData. By default, when you open a new R session in the same directory, this workspace is loaded and a message informing you so is printed: [Previously saved workspace restored]. It is often best practice to turn this feature off completely.",

Data Carpentry is an organization focused on data literacy, with the objective of teaching skills to researchers to enable them to retrieve, view, manipulate, analyze, and store their and other’s data in an open and reproducible way.\nThe above paragraph is made explicit since it is one of the core features of working with an open language like R. Many smart people willingly and actively share their material publicly, so that others can modify and build off of the material themselves.\nBy being open, we can “stand on the shoulders of giants” and continue to contribute for others to then stand on our shoulders. Not only does this help get work done, but it also adds to a feeling of community. In fact, there is a common saying in the open source world:\nThis saying captures the spirit, generosity, and fun involved in being a part of these open source projects.",

    "text": "2.3 Creating objects in R\nAs we saw in our first class, you can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:\n\n3 + 5\n\n[1] 8\n\n12 / 7\n\n[1] 1.714286\n\n\nHowever, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign values to objects.\n\nx &lt;- 3\nx + 5\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nYou can name an object in R almost anything you want:\n\njoel &lt;- 3\njoel + 5\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n2.3.0.1 Challenge\nSo far, we have created two variables, joel and x. What is the sum of these variables?\n\n\n2.3.1 Some tips on naming objects\n\nObjects can be given any name: x, current_temperature, thing, or subject_id.\nYou want your object names to be explicit and not too long.\nObject names cannot start with a number: x2 is valid, but 2x is not.\nR is also case sensitive: joel is different from Joel.\nAvoid using the names of existing functions (e.g. mean, df). You can check whether the name is already in use by using tab completion\nGenerally good to use underscores (_) to separate words in variable and function names\n\nIt is also recommended to use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names. It’s important to be consistent in the styling of your code (where you put spaces, how you name variables, etc.). Using a consistent coding style1 makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. RStudio will format code for you if you highlight a section of code and press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + a.\n\n\n2.3.2 Preforming calculations\nWhen assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 55    # doesn't print anything\n(weight_kg &lt;- 55)  # but putting parentheses around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`\n\n[1] 55\n\nweight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object\n\n[1] 55\n\n\nThe variable weight_kg is stored in the computer’s memory where R can access it, and we can start doing arithmetic with it efficiently. For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):\n\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 121\n\n\nWe can also change a variable’s value by assigning it a new one:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 57.5\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 126.5\n\n\nThis means that assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of other variables. For example, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a new variable, weight_lb:\n\nweight_lb &lt;- 2.2 * weight_kg # Actually, 1 kg = 2.204623 lbs\n\nand then change weight_kg to 100.\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 100\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Challenge\nWhat do you think is the current content of the object weight_lb? 126.5 or 220?\n\nweight_lb\n\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Challenge\nWhat are the values after each statement in the following?\n\nmass &lt;- 47.5\nage  &lt;- 122\nmass &lt;- mass * 2.0      # mass?\nage  &lt;- age - 20        # age?\nmass_index &lt;- mass/age  # mass_index?",

    "section": "2.4 Functions and their arguments",
    "text": "2.4 Functions and their arguments\n\n2.4.1 Understanding functions\nFunctions can be thought of as recipes. You give a few ingredients as input to a function, and it will generate an output based on these ingredients. Just as with baking, both the ingredients and the actual recipe will influence what comes out of the recipe in the end: will it be a cake or a loaf of bread? In R, the inputs to a function are not called ingredients, but rather arguments, and the output is called the return value of the function. A function does not technically have to return a value, but often does so. Functions are used to automate more complicated sets of commands and many of them are already predefined in R. A typical example would be the function sqrt(). The input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function (‘running it’) is called calling the function. An example of a function call is:\n\nsqrt(9)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWhich is the same as assigning the value to a variable and then passing that variable to the function:\n\na &lt;- 9\nb &lt;- sqrt(a)\nb\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nHere, the value of a is given to the sqrt() function, the sqrt() function calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to variable b. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.\nThe return ‘value’ of a function need not be numerical (like that of sqrt()), and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or even a dataset, as we will see later on.\nArguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a default value: these are called options. Options are typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether it ignores ‘bad values’, or what symbol to use in a plot. However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice which will be used instead of the default.\n\n\n2.4.2 Tab-completion\nTo access help about sqrt, we are first going to learn about tab-completion. Type s and press Tab.\n\ns&lt;tab&gt;q\n\nYou can see that R gives you suggestions of what functions and variables are available that start with the letter s, and thanks to RStudio they are formatted in this nice list. There are many suggestions here, so let’s be a bit more specific and append a q, to find what we want. If we press enter or tab again, R will insert the selected option.\nYou can see that R inserts a pair of parentheses together with the name of the function. This is how the function syntax looks for R and many other programming languages, and it means that within these parentheses, we will specify all the arguments (the ingredients) that we want to pass to this function.\nIf we press tab again, R will helpfully display all the available parameters for this function that we can pass an argument to. The word parameter is used to describe the name that the argument can be passed to. More on that later.\n\nsqrt(&lt;tab&gt;\n\nThere are many things in this list, but only one of them is marked in purple. Purple here means that this list item is a parameter we can use for the function, while yellow means that it is a variable that we defined earlier.2\n\n\n2.4.3 Help with defined functions\nTo read the full help about sqrt, we can use the question mark, or type it directly into the help document browser.\n\n?sqrt\n\nAs you can see, sqrt() takes only one argument, x, which needs to be a numerical vector. Don’t worry too much about the fact that it says vector here; we will talk more about that later. Briefly, a numerical vector is one or more numbers. In R, every number is a vector, so you don’t have to do anything special to create a vector. More on vectors later.\nLet’s try a function that can take multiple arguments: round().\n\nround(&lt;tab&gt;)\n?round\n\nIf we try round with a value:\n\nround(3.14159)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nHere, we’ve called round() with just one argument, 3.14159, and it has returned the value 3. That’s because the default is to round to the nearest whole number, or integer. If we want more digits we can pass an argument to the digits parameter, to specify how many decimals we want to round to.\n\nround(3.14159, digits = 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nSo, above we pass the argument 2, to the parameter digits. Knowing this nomenclature is not essential for doing your own data analysis, but it will be very helpful when you are reading through help documents online and in RStudio.\nWe can leave out the word digits since we know it comes as the second parameter, after x.\n\nround(3.14159, 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nAs you notice, we have been leaving out x from the beginning. If you provide the names for both the arguments, we can switch their order:\n\nround(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nIt’s good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you’re rounding) first in your function call, and to specify the names of all optional arguments. If you don’t, someone reading your code might have to look up the definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you’re doing.",

When you type sum, c(), or mean(), you are using a function that has been made previously and built into R. To remove some of the magic around these functions, we will go through how to make a basic function of our own.

    "section": "2.6 Vectors and data types",
    "text": "2.6 Vectors and data types\nA vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using the c() function, which stands for “concatenate (combine/connect one after another) values into a vector” For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object weight_g:\n\nweight_g &lt;- c(50, 60, 65, 82) # Concatenate/Combine values into a vector\nweight_g\n\n[1] 50 60 65 82\n\n\nYou can also use the built-in command seq, to create a sequence of numbers without typing all of them in manually.\n\nseq(0, 30) # This is the same as just `0:30`\n\n [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n[26] 25 26 27 28 29 30\n\nseq(0, 30, 3) # Every third number\n\n [1]  0  3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30\n\n\nA vector can also contain characters:\n\nanimals &lt;- c('mouse', 'rat', 'dog')\nanimals\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\n\nThe quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here and can be either single or double quotes. Without the quotes R will assume there are objects called mouse, rat and dog. As these objects don’t exist in R’s memory, there will be an error message.\nThere are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. length() tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:\n\nlength(weight_g)\n\n[1] 4\n\nlength(animals)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAn important feature of a vector is that all of the elements are the same type of data. The function class() indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:\n\nclass(weight_g)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(animals)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThe function str() provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:\n\nstr(weight_g)\n\n num [1:4] 50 60 65 82\n\nstr(animals)\n\n chr [1:3] \"mouse\" \"rat\" \"dog\"\n\n\nYou can use the c() function to add other elements to your vector:\n\nweight_g &lt;- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector\nweight_g &lt;- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector\nweight_g\n\n[1] 30 50 60 65 82 90\n\n\nIn the first line, we take the original vector weight_g, add the value 90 to the end of it, and save the result back into weight_g. Then we add the value 30 to the beginning, again saving the result back into weight_g.\nWe can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.\nAn atomic vector is the simplest R data type and it is a linear vector of a single type, e.g. all numbers. Above, we saw 2 of the 6 main atomic vector types that R uses: \"character\" and \"numeric\" (or \"double\"). These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built from.\nVectors are one of the many data structures that R uses. Other important ones are lists (list), matrices (matrix), data frames (data.frame), factors (factor) and arrays (array). In this class, we will focus on data frames, which is most commonly used one for data analyses.\n\n2.6.0.1 Challenge\nWe’ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector? Find out by using class to test these examples.\n\nnum_char &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 'a')\nnum_logical &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)\nchar_logical &lt;- c('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)\ntricky &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, '4')\n\nThis happens because vectors can be of only one data type. Instead of throwing an error and saying that you are trying to mix different types in the same vector, R tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a “common denominator”. A logical can be turn into 1 or 0, and a number can be turned into a string/character representation. It would be difficult to do it the other way around: would 5 be TRUE or FALSE? What number would ‘t’ be?\nIn R, we call converting objects from one class into another class coercion. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?\nThis can be important to watch for in data sets that you import.",

    "section": "2.7 Subsetting vectors",
    "text": "2.7 Subsetting vectors\nIf we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one or several indices in square brackets. For instance:\n\nanimals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\", \"cat\")\nanimals[2]\n\n[1] \"rat\"\n\nanimals[c(3, 2)]\n\n[1] \"dog\" \"rat\"\n\n\nWe can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the original one:\n\nmore_animals &lt;- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]\nmore_animals\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"   \"rat\"   \"mouse\" \"cat\"  \n\n\nR indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that’s what human beings typically do. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that was historically simpler for computers and can allow for more elegant code.\n\n2.7.1 Conditional subsetting\nAnother common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. TRUE will select the element with the same index, while FALSE will not:\n\nweight_g &lt;- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)\nweight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]\n\n[1] 21 39 54\n\n\nTypically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the values above 50:\n\nweight_g &gt; 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n## so we can use this to select only the values above 50\nweight_g[weight_g &gt; 50]\n\n[1] 54 55\n\n\nWe will consider conditions in more detail in the next few lectures.\n\n\n2.7.2 Strings (character vectors)\nJust a small note about character vectors, also called strings. There are built-in packages for subsetting them that we’ll learn about later. They can be particularly relevant for ecological and genomic data because important data can be nested in complicated strings of text (ex: extracting only the observations that occurred in wet habitats from a column of habitat descriptions or only genes with functions related to drought tolerance).\n\nstring1 &lt;- \"This is a string\" # you can include spaces between your quotes\nstring2 &lt;- c(string1, \"so is this\") # concatenate with another string\nstring2[2] # can access the second string via subsetting\n\n[1] \"so is this\"\n\n# Playing a bit with declaring variables\n\"You can include 'quotes' in a string\"\n\n[1] \"You can include 'quotes' in a string\"\n\nstring3 &lt;- 'You can include \"quotes\" in a string'\nstring3\n\n[1] \"You can include \\\"quotes\\\" in a string\"\n\n\"You can include \\\"matching quotes\\\" if you 'escape' them with a backslash (\\\\)\"\n\n[1] \"You can include \\\"matching quotes\\\" if you 'escape' them with a backslash (\\\\)\"",

It is still important that you understand the concept of loops and you might also use them in some of your own functions if there is no vectorized way of going about what you want to do.\nYou can think of a for-loop as: “for each number contained in a list/vector, perform this operation” and the syntax basically says the same thing:\n\nv &lt;- c(2, 4, 6)\nfor (num in v) {\n    print(num)\n}\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n[1] 6\n\n\nInstead of printing out every number to the console, we could also add numbers cumulatively, to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the vector:\n\n# To increment `w` each time, we must first create the variable,\n# which we do by setting `w &lt;- 0`, referred to as initializing.\n# This also ensures that `w` is zero at the start of the loop and\n# doesn't retain the value from last time we ran this code.\nw &lt;- 0\nfor (num in v) {\n    w &lt;- w + num\n}\nw\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nIf we put what we just did inside a function, we have essentially recreated the sum function in R.\n\nmy_sum &lt;- function(input_vector) {\n    vector_sum &lt;- 0\n    for (num in input_vector){\n        vector_sum &lt;- vector_sum + num\n    }\n    return(vector_sum)\n}\n\nmy_sum(v)\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nAlthough this gives us the same output as the built-in function sum, the built-in function has many more optimizations so it is much faster than our function. In R, it is always faster to try to find a way of doing things without writing a loop yourself. When you are reading about R, you might see suggestions that you should try to vectorize your code to make it faster. What people are referring to, is that you should not write for loops in R and instead use the ready-made functions that are much more efficient in working with vectors and essentially performs operations on entire vector at once instead of one number at a time. Conceptually, loops operate on one element at a time while vectorized code operates on all elements of a vector at once.",

    "text": "2.10 Dataset background\nToday, we will be working with real data from a longitudinal study of the species abundance in the Chihuahuan desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. This study includes observations of plants, ants, and rodents from 1977 - 2002, and has been used in over 100 publications. More information is available in the abstract of this paper from 2009. There are several datasets available related to this study, and we will be working with datasets that have been preprocessed by the Data Carpentry to facilitate teaching. These are made available online as The Portal Project Teaching Database, both at the Data Carpentry website, and on Figshare. Figshare is a great place to publish data, code, figures, and more openly to make them available for other researchers and to communicate findings that are not part of a longer paper.\n\n2.10.1 Presentation of the survey data\nWe are studying the species and weight of animals caught in plots in our study area. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file. Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:\n\n\n\nColumn\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrecord_id\nunique id for the observation\n\n\nmonth\nmonth of observation\n\n\nday\nday of observation\n\n\nyear\nyear of observation\n\n\nplot_id\nID of a particular plot\n\n\nspecies_id\n2-letter code\n\n\nsex\nsex of animal (“M”, “F”)\n\n\nhindfoot_length\nlength of the hindfoot in mm\n\n\nweight\nweight of the animal in grams\n\n\ngenus\ngenus of animal\n\n\nspecies\nspecies of animal\n\n\ntaxa\ne.g. rodent, reptile, bird, rabbit\n\n\nplot_type\ntype of plot\n\n\n\nTo read the data into R, we are going to use a function called read_csv. This function is contained in an R-package called readr. R-packages are a bit like browser extensions; they are not essential, but can provide nifty functionality. We will go through R-packages in general and which ones are good for data analyses. One useful option that read_csv includes, is the ability to read a CSV file directly from a URL, without downloading it in a separate step:\n\nsurveys &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169')\n\nHowever, it is often a good idea to download the data first, so you have a copy stored locally on your computer in case you want to do some offline analyses, or the online version of the file changes or the file is taken down. You can either download the data manually or from within R:\n\ndownload.file(\"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169\",\n              \"data/portal_data.csv\") # Saves to current directory with this name\n\nThe data is read in by specifying its local path.\n\nsurveys &lt;- readr::read_csv('data/portal_data.csv')\n\nRows: 34786 Columns: 13\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (6): species_id, sex, genus, species, taxa, plot_type\ndbl (7): record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, hindfoot_length, weight\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThis statement produces some output regarding which data type it found in each column. If we want to check this in more detail, we can print the variable’s value: surveys.\n\nsurveys\n\n# A tibble: 34,786 × 13\n   record_id month   day  year plot_id species_id sex   hindfoot_length weight\n       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1     7    16  1977       2 NL         M                  32     NA\n 2        72     8    19  1977       2 NL         M                  31     NA\n 3       224     9    13  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n 4       266    10    16  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n 5       349    11    12  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n 6       363    11    12  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n 7       435    12    10  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n 8       506     1     8  1978       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n 9       588     2    18  1978       2 NL         M                  NA    218\n10       661     3    11  1978       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n# ℹ 34,776 more rows\n# ℹ 4 more variables: genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, taxa &lt;chr&gt;, plot_type &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nThis displays a nice tabular view of the data, which also includes pagination when there are many rows and we can click the arrow to view all the columns. Technically, this object is actually a tibble rather than a data frame, as indicated in the output. The reason for this is that read_csv automatically converts the data into to a tibble when loading it. Since a tibble is just a data frame with some convenient extra functionality, we will use these words interchangeably from now on.\nIf we just want to glance at how the data frame looks, it is sufficient to display only the top (the first 6 lines) using the function head():\n\nhead(surveys)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 13\n  record_id month   day  year plot_id species_id sex   hindfoot_length weight\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1     7    16  1977       2 NL         M                  32     NA\n2        72     8    19  1977       2 NL         M                  31     NA\n3       224     9    13  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n4       266    10    16  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n5       349    11    12  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n6       363    11    12  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n# ℹ 4 more variables: genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, taxa &lt;chr&gt;, plot_type &lt;chr&gt;",

    "text": "2.11 What are data frames?\nData frames are the de facto data structure for most tabular data, and what we use for statistics and plotting. A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the function read_csv(); in other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).\nA data frame is a representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because the columns are vectors, they all contain the same type of data as we discussed in last class (e.g., characters, integers, factors). We can see this when inspecting the structure of a data frame with the function str():\n\nstr(surveys)\n\nspc_tbl_ [34,786 × 13] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ record_id      : num [1:34786] 1 72 224 266 349 363 435 506 588 661 ...\n $ month          : num [1:34786] 7 8 9 10 11 11 12 1 2 3 ...\n $ day            : num [1:34786] 16 19 13 16 12 12 10 8 18 11 ...\n $ year           : num [1:34786] 1977 1977 1977 1977 1977 ...\n $ plot_id        : num [1:34786] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ species_id     : chr [1:34786] \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" ...\n $ sex            : chr [1:34786] \"M\" \"M\" NA NA ...\n $ hindfoot_length: num [1:34786] 32 31 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ weight         : num [1:34786] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 218 NA ...\n $ genus          : chr [1:34786] \"Neotoma\" \"Neotoma\" \"Neotoma\" \"Neotoma\" ...\n $ species        : chr [1:34786] \"albigula\" \"albigula\" \"albigula\" \"albigula\" ...\n $ taxa           : chr [1:34786] \"Rodent\" \"Rodent\" \"Rodent\" \"Rodent\" ...\n $ plot_type      : chr [1:34786] \"Control\" \"Control\" \"Control\" \"Control\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   record_id = col_double(),\n  ..   month = col_double(),\n  ..   day = col_double(),\n  ..   year = col_double(),\n  ..   plot_id = col_double(),\n  ..   species_id = col_character(),\n  ..   sex = col_character(),\n  ..   hindfoot_length = col_double(),\n  ..   weight = col_double(),\n  ..   genus = col_character(),\n  ..   species = col_character(),\n  ..   taxa = col_character(),\n  ..   plot_type = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n\nInteger refers to a whole number, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Numbers with decimals, 1.0, 2.4, 3.333, are referred to as floats. Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or unordered, and understanding them is necessary for statistical analysis and for plotting. Factors are stored as integers, and have labels (text) associated with these unique integers. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them like strings.\n\n2.11.1 Inspecting data.frame objects\nWe already saw how the functions head() and str() can be useful to check the content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let’s try them out!\n\nSize:\n\ndim(surveys) - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element and the number of columns as the second element (the dimensions of the object)\nnrow(surveys) - returns the number of rows\nncol(surveys) - returns the number of columns\n\nContent:\n\nhead(surveys) - shows the first 6 rows\ntail(surveys) - shows the last 6 rows\n\nNames:\n\nnames(surveys) - returns the column names (synonym of colnames() for data.frame objects)\nrownames(surveys) - returns the row names\n\nSummary:\n\nstr(surveys) - structure of the object and information about the class, length, and content of each column\nsummary(surveys) - summary statistics for each column\n\n\nNote: most of these functions are “generic”, they can be used on other types of objects besides data.frame.\n\n2.11.1.1 Challenge\nBased on the output of str(surveys), can you answer the following questions?\n\nWhat is the class of the object surveys?\nHow many rows and how many columns are in this object?\nHow many species have been recorded during these surveys?\n\n\n\n\n2.11.2 Indexing and subsetting data frames\nOur survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions). If we want to extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the “coordinates” we want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. When indexing, base R data frames return a different format depending on how we index the data (i.e. either a vector or a data frame), but with enhanced data frames, tibbles, the returned object is almost always a data frame.\n\nsurveys[1, 1]   # first element in the first column of the data frame\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  record_id\n      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1\n\nsurveys[1, 6]   # first element in the 6th column\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  species_id\n  &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 NL        \n\nsurveys[, 1]    # first column in the data frame\n\n# A tibble: 34,786 × 1\n   record_id\n       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1\n 2        72\n 3       224\n 4       266\n 5       349\n 6       363\n 7       435\n 8       506\n 9       588\n10       661\n# ℹ 34,776 more rows\n\nsurveys[1]      # first column in the data frame\n\n# A tibble: 34,786 × 1\n   record_id\n       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1\n 2        72\n 3       224\n 4       266\n 5       349\n 6       363\n 7       435\n 8       506\n 9       588\n10       661\n# ℹ 34,776 more rows\n\nsurveys[1:3, 7] # first three elements in the 7th column\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 1\n  sex  \n  &lt;chr&gt;\n1 M    \n2 M    \n3 &lt;NA&gt; \n\nsurveys[3, ]    # the 3rd element for all columns\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 13\n  record_id month   day  year plot_id species_id sex   hindfoot_length weight\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       224     9    13  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n# ℹ 4 more variables: genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, taxa &lt;chr&gt;, plot_type &lt;chr&gt;\n\nsurveys[1:6, ]  # equivalent to head(surveys)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 13\n  record_id month   day  year plot_id species_id sex   hindfoot_length weight\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1     7    16  1977       2 NL         M                  32     NA\n2        72     8    19  1977       2 NL         M                  31     NA\n3       224     9    13  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n4       266    10    16  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n5       349    11    12  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n6       363    11    12  1977       2 NL         &lt;NA&gt;               NA     NA\n# ℹ 4 more variables: genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, taxa &lt;chr&gt;, plot_type &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n: is a special operator that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing or decreasing order; test 1:10 and 10:1 for instance.

RStudio knows about the columns in your data frame, so you can take advantage of the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct column name.\nAnother syntax that is often used to specify column names is $. In this case, the returned object is actually a vector. We will not go into detail about this, but since it is such common usage, it is good to be aware of this.\n\n# We use `head()` since the output from vectors are not automatically cut off\n# and we don't want to clutter the screen with all the `species_id` values\nhead(surveys$species_id)          # Result is a vector\n\n[1] \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\"\n\n\n\n2.11.2.1 Challenge\n\nCreate a data.frame (surveys_200) containing only the observations from row 200 of the surveys dataset.\nNotice how nrow() gave you the number of rows in a data.frame?\n\nUse that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.\nCompare that with what you see as the last row using tail() to make sure it’s meeting expectations.\nPull out that last row using nrow() instead of the row number.\nCreate a new data frame object (surveys_last) from that last row.\n\nUse nrow() to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named surveys_middle.\nCombine nrow() with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of head(surveys) keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.",
