It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be recognized as a resource, strength, and benefit.\nDiversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, national origin, language, cultural heritage, physical ability, neurodiversity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and socio-economic class. Each of these varied, and often intersecting, identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives we bring to this class, to this department, and to the greater EEB community. We will work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.\nWe expect that everybody in this class will respect each other, and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other people’s perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from their own. Racist, sexist, colonialist, homophobic, transphobic, and other abusive and discriminatory behavior and language will not be tolerated in this class and will result in disciplinary action, such as removal from class session or revocation of group working privileges. Please consult the University of Toronto Code of Student Conduct for details on unacceptable conduct and possible sanctions.\nPlease let us know if something said or done in this class, by either a member of the teaching team or other students, is particularly troubling or causes discomfort or offense. While our intention may not be to cause discomfort or offense, the impact of what happens throughout the course is not to be ignored and is something that we consider to be very important and deserving of attention. If and when this occurs, there are several ways to alleviate some of the discomfort or hurt you may experience:\n\nDiscuss the situation privately with a member of the teaching team. We are always open to listening to students’ experiences, and want to work with students to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue.\nNotify us of the issue through another source such as a trusted faculty member or a peer. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing the issue directly with us, we encourage you to seek out another, more comfortable avenue to address the issue.\nContact the Anti-Racism and Cultural Diversity Office to report an incident and receive complaint resolution support, which may include consultations and referrals.\n\nWe acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a community that increasingly embraces these core values. Your suggestions and feedback are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups."

Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UTSG, and is co-advised by Matt Osmond & Nicole Mideo. He uses mathematical models to address questions in evolutionary genetics and ecology. He is currently developing theory to understand patterns, causes, and consequences of pathogen recombination. Mete was an undergraduate math & statistics student at the University of Idaho. There, he worked on the ecology of gene drive interventions against vectored diseases, understanding how continuous spatial structure can affect species coexistence, and forecasting the dynamics of Chinook salmon in the Willamette River system. He loves modeling, statistics, and programming in R (among other languages!) - and is thrilled to be teaching this course! Outside of science, he enjoys listening to podcasts, cooking, and cycling between Toronto neighborhoods in search of coffee.\nVicki Zhang (vm.zhang@mail.utoronto.ca)\nVicki is a PhD Candidate in Peter Kotanen’s lab at UTM. She studies invasive species at the edge of the Arctic, and how climate change and anthropogenic stressors might affect the persistence and spread of invasive species in Canada’s tundra and boreal forests. Vicki does fieldwork in Churchill, Manitoba (the polar bear capital of the world) in the summer, but does a lot of data analyses and modelling on R throughout the fall and winter semesters. She took EEB313 in 2018, and it was her favourite undergraduate course because everything about R just clicked, and she learned so much about coding, statistics, and modelling (her previous encounters with R and stats went very poorly). Now, she spends a lot of time making sure that her data is clean and her code is fast - it’s so satisfying when every line finally runs! For Vicki, the best way to work in R is with a big cup of coffee, soft classical music in the background, and her cat Remi napping next to her."

    "section": "Working with computers",
    "text": "Working with computers\nBefore we get into more practical matters, we want to provide a brief background to the idea of working with computers. Essentially, computer work is about humans communicating with a computer by modulating flows of current in the hardware in order to get the computer to carry out advanced calculations that we are unable to efficiently compute ourselves. Early examples of human computer communication were quite primitive and included physically disconnecting a wire and connecting it again in a different spot. Luckily, we are not doing this anymore; instead we have programs with graphical user interfaces with menus and buttons that enable more efficient human to computer communication.\n\n1.0.3 Graphical user interfaces vs. text based user interfaces\nAn example of such a program that many of you are familiar with is spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. Here, all the functionality of the program is accessible via hierarchical menus, and clicking buttons sends instructions to the computer, which then responds and sends the results back to your screen. For instance, I can click a button to send the instruction of coloring this cell yellow, and the computer interprets my instructions and then displays the results on the screen.\nSpreadsheet software is great for viewing and entering small data sets and creating simple visualizations fast. However, it can be tricky to design figures, create automatic reproducible analysis workflows, perform advanced calculations, and reliably clean data sets. Even when using a spreadsheet program to record data, it is often beneficial to have some some basic programming skills to facilitate the analyses of those data.\nTyping commands directly instead of searching for them in menus is a more efficient approach to communicate with the computer and a powerful way of doing data analysis. This is initially intimidating for almost all people, but if you compare it to learning a new language, the process becomes more intuitive: when learning a language, you would initially string together sentences by looking up individual words in the dictionary. As you improve, you will only reference the dictionary occasionally since you already know most of the words. Eventually, you will throw the dictionary out altogether because it is faster and more precise to speak directly. In contrast, graphical programs force you to look up every word in the dictionary every time, even if you already know what to say.\n\n\n1.0.4 RStudio and the R Notebook\nRStudio includes the R console, but also many other convenient functionalities, which makes it easier to get started and to work with R. When you launch RStudio, you will see four panels. Starting at the top left and going clockwise, these panels are:\n\nThe text editor panel. This is where we can write scripts, i.e. putting several commands of code together and saving them as a text document so that they are accessible for later and so that we can execute them all at once by running the script instead of typing them in one by one.\nThe environment panel, which shows us all the files and objects we currently loaded into R.\nThe files-plots-help panel. This panel shows the files in the current directory (the folder we are working out of), any plots we make later, and also documentation for various packages and functions. Here, the documentation is formatted in a way that is easier to read and also provides links to the related sections.\nThe console is another space we can input code, only now the code is executed immediately and doesn’t get saved at the end.\n\nTo change the appearance of your RStudio, navigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Appearance. You can change the the font and size, and the editor theme. The default is “Textmate”, but if you like dark mode, I recommend “Tomorrow Night Bright”. You can also change how your panels are organized. I like to have my Console and history below my Source, and that way I can see my working environment next to my code. That way, I know if an error I am getting is because I am missing an object or I renamed something oddly. Let’s change that now. I recommend playing around with the appearance if you prefer a different layout or colour scheme. Do what makes you the most productive!\nAnother very useful thing with RStudio is that you have access to some excellent cheat sheets in PDF format straight from the menu: Help -&gt; Cheatsheets!\nIn the RStudio interface, we will be writing code in a format called the R Notebook. As the name entails, this interface works like a notebook for code, as it allows us to save notes about what the code is doing, the code itself, and any output we get, such as plots and tables, all together in the same document.\nWhen we are in the Notebook, the text we write is normal plain text, just as if we would be writing it in a text document. If we want to execute some R code, we need to insert a code chunk.\nYou insert a code chunk by either clicking the “Insert” button or pressing Ctrl/Command + Alt + i simultaneously. You could also type out the surrounding backticks, but this would take longer. To run a code chunk, you press the green arrow, or Ctrl/Command + Shift + Enter.\n\n1+1\n#&gt; [1] 2\n\nAs you can see, the output appears right under the code block.\nThis is a great way to perform explore your data, since you can do your analysis and write comments and conclusions right under it all in the same document. A powerful feature of this workflow is that there is no extra time needed for code documentation and note-taking, since you’re doing your analyses and taking notes at the same time. This makes it great for both taking notes at lectures and to have as a reference when you return to your code in the future."

This format allows us to combine R code with the Markdown text format, which enables the use of certain characters to specify headings, bullet points, quotations and even citations. A simple example of how to write in Markdown is to use a single asterisk or underscore to emphasize text (*emphasis*) and two asterisks or underscores to strongly emphasize text (**strong emphasis**). When we convert our R Markdown text to other file formats, these will show up as italics and bold typeface, respectively. If you have used WhatsApp, you might already be familiar with this style of writing. In case you haven’t seen it before, you have just learned something about WhatsApp in your quantitative methods class…\nTo learn more about R Markdown, you can read the cheat sheets in RStudio and RStudio Markdown reference online.\n\n1.1.1 Saving data and generating reports\nTo save our notes, code, and graphs, all we have to do is to save the R Notebook file, and the we can open it in RStudio next time again. However, if we want someone else to look at this, we can’t always just send them the R Notebook file, because they might not have RStudio installed. Another great feature of R Notebooks is that it is really easy to export them to HTML, MS word, or PDF documents with figures and professional typesetting. There are actually many academic papers that are written entirely in this format and it is great for assignments and reports. (You might even use it to communicate with your collaborators!) Since R Notebook files convert to HTML, it is also easy to publish simple and good-looking websites in it, in which code chunks are embedded nicely within the text.\nLet’s try to create a document in R.\nFirst, let’s set up the YAML block. This is found at the top of your document, and it is where you specify the title of your document, what kind of output you want, and a few other things such as author list and date.\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your title here\"\nauthor: \"Your name here\"\ndate: \"Insert date\"\n---\n\nThen, let’s type some notes and code together!\n\n# Attempt 1\n\n## Here goes!\n\n\n1+2+3+4\n#&gt; [1] 10\n\nx &lt;- seq(0,100,1)\n\nplot(x, type = \"l\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see what this looks like. To create the output document, we poetically say that we will knit our R Markdown into the HTML document. Luckily, it is much simpler than actually knitting something. Simply press the Knit button here and the new document will be created.\nAs you can see in the knitted document, the title showed up as we would expect, the lines with pound sign(s) in front of them were converted into headers and we can see both the code and its output! So the plots are generated directly in the report without us having to cut and paste images! If we change something in the code, we don’t have to find the new images and paste it in again, the correct one will appear right in your code.\nWhen you quit, R will ask you if you want to save the workspace (that is, all of the variables you have defined in this session); in general, you should say “no” to avoid clutter and unintentional confusion of results from different sessions. Note: When you say “yes” to saving your workspace, it is saved in a hidden file named .RData. By default, when you open a new R session in the same directory, this workspace is loaded and a message informing you so is printed: [Previously saved workspace restored]."

In fact, if you are following along this far, you should have already been typing your notes and code in a .Rmd file, or a RMarkdown file.\nLet’s introduce more Markdown features! We encourage groups to try completing their group projects in RMarkdown, but more about that later.\n\n2.2.1 In-line code\nWe talked about using RMarkdown for notes and inline code last class. This is extremely useful for when you need to update objects or rerun analyses. You can also comment out code within the code chunk.\nAs a reminder, the keyboard shortcut to insert a code chunk is:\n\ncommand + option + i (Mac)\nctrl + alt + i (Windows)\n\n\nx &lt;- 5\ny &lt;- 13\n\n# 5 plus 13\nx + y\n\n[1] 18\n\n\n\n2.2.1.1 R code chunk tricks\n\neval=TRUE evaluates the code chunk (runs it); eval=FALSE does not (will just print the chunk)\necho=TRUE prints the code chunk; echo=FALSE hides it but will still evaluate it\n\nthis is useful if you need to save something as an object but you don’t necessarily need it to print\n\nwarning=FALSE will hide warnings; message=FALSE will hide messages from output\n\nonly the case when eval=TRUE\n\n\n\n## eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE prints output, but does not print code chunk\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nqplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars)\n\nWarning: `qplot()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Changing height and width of images/figures\nYou can also indicate the sizes of figures by using fig.width and fig.height in your code chunk.\n\n## in this R chuck, fig.width=2, fig.height=2\nqplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Lists\nI’ve already used these! You can use either * or - to indicate unordered lists. To indent, hit tab. Make sure there’s a space before your items in the list.\nUnordered Lists (bullet points)\n\nfirst item\nsecond item\n\nsub-level item (two tabs)\n\nthird item\n\nFor ordered lists, use numbers. Again, hit tab to add sublists.\nOrdered Lists (numbers)\n\nOrdered item\nOrdered item\n\nOrdered sub-item\n\nItem (will automatically re-number)\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Tables\nkable displays r code chunks with tables nicely\nlibrary(knitr)\nkable(head(mtcars))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n\nMazda RX4\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\nMazda RX4 Wag\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\nDatsun 710\n22.8\n4\n108\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\nHornet 4 Drive\n21.4\n6\n258\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\nHornet Sportabout\n18.7\n8\n360\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\nValiant\n18.1\n6\n225\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison:\nlibrary(knitr)\nhead(mtcars) ## does not nicely format the table\n               mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1\n\n\n2.2.4 Images and Links\nUse the following format to add images:\n![Description/Caption](/path/to/image.png)\nFor example: \nAs an aside, let’s talk about rubber duck debugging. It is a simple but effective technique used by scientists to debug code. By explaining the code line-by-line to an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck, programmers can break down the code into smaller, more manageable pieces, and potentially identify the root cause of the problem. Or, explain it to a friend in the course! They can also help you find typos and other errors\nAnd use the following format to add weblinks: [Description/Caption](weblink).\nThe EEB website lives here!\n\n\n2.2.5 White Space and New Page\nUse \\vspace{2pt} to add white space, and use \\newpage to add a page break.\n\n\n2.2.6 In-line citations and bibliography\nExport a .bib file (e.g., from Zotero and Mendeley). Then, add the .bib to your YAML header.\n---\ntitle: My Report\noutput: html_document\nbibliography: bibliography.bib\n---\nNow, you can cite directly in your report, like below:\nSome fact[@Smith2018]\nSome fact supported by multiple papers [@Smith2018; @Tran1997]\n\n\n2.2.7 Footnotes\nThis is what a footnote looks like.1 Here is another.2"

    "section": "2.3 Project-Oriented Workflow",
    "text": "2.3 Project-Oriented Workflow\n\n2.3.1 Projects\nMaterial adapted from Posit and R-bloggers.\nRStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.\nTo create a new project in the RStudio IDE, use the Create Project command (top right). You can link your new project to an existing directory, or create a new directory entirely. Since we already have some RMarkdown written, let’s add our project to an existing directory.\nWhen a new project is created RStudio, it creates a project file (with an .Rproj extension) within the project directory. This file contains various project options (discussed below) and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the filesystem. It also creates a hidden directory (named .Rproj.user) where project-specific temporary files (e.g., auto-saved source documents, window-state, etc.) are stored. This directory is also automatically added to .Rbuildignore, .gitignore, etc. if required.\nNow, whenever you open your project, it loads your project into RStudio and displays its name in the Projects toolbar (which is located on the far right side of the main toolbar). It even takes you back to where you were working last, so it opens all the scripts and files that were last open! You can also save your history, the objects in your environment, and an image of what your project looked like at the last time you closed it, but this can take up a lot of space if you do this each time.\nYou can work with more than one RStudio project at a time by simply opening each project in its own window of RStudio.\n\n\n2.3.2 Relative File Pathways\nThe goal of the here package is to enable easy file referencing in project-oriented workflows. In contrast to using setwd(), which is fragile and dependent on the way you organize your files, here uses the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files.\n\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /Users/meteyuksel/eeb313website\n\nhere()\n\n[1] \"/Users/meteyuksel/eeb313website\"\n\n\nYou can build a path relative to the top-level directory in order to read or write a file:\n\nhere(\"1_lectures\", \"csv\", \"portal_data.csv\")\n\n[1] \"/Users/meteyuksel/eeb313website/1_lectures/csv/portal_data.csv\"\n\n\nThese relative paths work regardless of where the associated source file lives inside your project, like analysis projects with data and reports in different subdirectories.\n\n\n2.3.3 Demo Project\nThere is no a single “right” folder structure for analysis projects. However, this is a tried-and-true simple method that works (backed up by many data scientists!).\nCreate a folder on your computer that holds all the files relevant to that particular piece of work. This parent folder will contain the project’s .Rproj and all other subfolders, so it should have the same name as your project. Pick a good one. Spending an extra 5 minutes will save you from regrets in the future. The name should be short, concise, written in lower-case, and not containing any special symbols. One can apply similar strategies as for naming packages.\nUse subdirectories to organize data, code, figures, notes, etc.\n\nThe folder data typically contains two subfolders, namely, raw and processed. The content of raw directory is data files of any kind, such as .csv, SAS, Excel, text and database files, etc. The content of this folder is read-only, so that no scripts should change the original files or create new ones inside it. For this purpose, the processed directory is used: all processed, cleaned, and tidied datasets are saved here. It is a good practice to save files in R specific format, rather than in .csv, since the saving in .csv is a less efficient way of storing data (both in terms of space and time of reading/writing).\nThe folder figures is the place where you may store plots, diagrams, and other figures. There is not much to say about it. Common extensions of such files are .eps, .png, .pdf, etc. Again, file names in this folder should be meaningful (the name img1.png does not represent anything).\nAll reports live in a directory with the corresponding name reports. These reports can be of any formats, such as LaTeX, Markdown, R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, etc. Currently, more and more people prefer rich documents with text and executable code to LaTeX and such.\nPerhaps the most important folder is analyses or scripts. Here, you keep all your R scripts and codes. That is the exact place to use prefix numbers, if files should be run in a particular order. If you have files in other scripted languages (e.g., Python), it is better to keep them in this folder as well. There can also an important subfolder called deprecated. Whenever you want to remove one or the other script, it is a good idea to move it to deprecated at first iteration. I recommend never deleting your code until you are sure that you have finished everything you wanted to do, even if the code doesn’t work (going back to it after a break usually helps!).\n\n\n\n\nVicki’s demo of her file directory.\n\n\nThis convention guarantees that the project is self-contained, and it can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work”. This is a really important convention that creates reliable, reproducible science across different computers or users and over time.\n\n\n2.3.4 Documenting session info\nAs an overview of our environment, we can also use the sessionInfo() command. This is a good practice to have at the end of your code to document which packages you used and what version they were.\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)\nPlatform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Big Sur ... 10.16\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib\nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] here_1.0.1    knitr_1.43    ggplot2_3.4.3\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] rstudioapi_0.15.0 magrittr_2.0.3    tidyselect_1.2.0  munsell_0.5.0    \n [5] colorspace_2.1-0  R6_2.5.1          rlang_1.1.1       fastmap_1.1.1    \n [9] fansi_1.0.4       dplyr_1.1.2       tools_4.2.3       grid_4.2.3       \n[13] gtable_0.3.3      xfun_0.39         utf8_1.2.3        cli_3.6.1        \n[17] withr_2.5.0       htmltools_0.5.5   rprojroot_2.0.3   yaml_2.3.7       \n[21] digest_0.6.33     tibble_3.2.1      lifecycle_1.0.3   farver_2.1.1     \n[25] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 vctrs_0.6.3       glue_1.6.2        evaluate_0.21    \n[29] rmarkdown_2.23    labeling_0.4.2    compiler_4.2.3    pillar_1.9.0     \n[33] generics_0.1.3    scales_1.2.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    pkgconfig_2.0.3  \n\n\nNotice that we have some base packages active even though we did not explicitly call for them."

    "text": "3.4 Some tips on naming objects\n\nObjects can be given any name: x, current_temperature, thing, or subject_id.\nYou want your object names to be explicit and not too long.\nObject names cannot start with a number: x2 is valid, but 2x is not valid.\nR is also case sensitive: joel is different from Joel.\n\nIt is recommended to use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names. It’s important to be consistent in the styling of your code (where you put spaces, how you name variables, etc.). Using a consistent coding style1 makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. RStudio will format code for you if you highlight a section of code and press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + a.\n\n3.4.1 Preforming calculations\nWhen assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 55    # doesn't print anything\n(weight_kg &lt;- 55)  # putting parentheses around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`\n\n[1] 55\n\nweight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object\n\n[1] 55\n\n\nThe variable weight_kg is stored in the computer’s memory where R can access it, and we can start doing arithmetic with it efficiently. For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds:\n\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 121\n\n\nWe can also change a variable’s value by assigning it a new one:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 57.5\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 126.5\n\n\nImportantly, assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of other variables. For example, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a new variable, weight_lb:\n\nweight_lb &lt;- 2.2 * weight_kg\n\nand then change weight_kg to 100.\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 100\nweight_lb\n\n[1] 126.5\n\n\nNotice that weight_lb is unchanged.\n\n3.4.1.1 Challenge\nWhat are the values of these variables after each statement in the following?\n\nmass &lt;- 47.5\nage  &lt;- 122\nmass &lt;- mass * 2.0      \nage  &lt;- age - 20  \nmass_index &lt;- mass/age"

    "text": "3.5 Functions and their arguments!\nFunctions are sets of statements that are organized to preform certain tasks. They can be understood through analogy with cooking. Ingredients (called inputs or arguments) combine according to some set of reactions (the statements and commands of the function) to yield a product or output. A function does not have to return a number: a list of values could be returned, another function, or a list of functions.\nMany functions are built into R, including sqrt(). For sqrt(), the input must be a number larger than zero, and the value that is returned by the function is the square root of that number. Executing a function is called running or calling the function. An example of a function call is:\n\nsqrt(9)\n\n[1] 3\n\n# the input must be in the domain of the function:\nsqrt(\"hello\")\n\nError in sqrt(\"hello\"): non-numeric argument to mathematical function\n\nsqrt(-1) # note: sqrt() can take in *complex* numbers, including -1+0i\n\nWarning in sqrt(-1): NaNs produced\n\n\n[1] NaN\n\n\nThis is the same as assigning the value to a variable and then passing that variable to the function:\n\na &lt;- 9\nb &lt;- sqrt(a)\nb\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nHere, the value of a is given to the sqrt() function, the sqrt() function calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to variable b. This set up is important when you write more complex functions where multiple variables are passed to different arguments in different parts of a function.\nsqrt() is very simple because it takes just one argument. Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or files. Some functions take arguments which may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a default value: these are called options. Options are typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether it ignores ‘bad values’, or what symbol to use in a plot. However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice which will be used instead of the default.\n\n3.5.1 Tab-completion\nTo access help about sqrt, tab-completion can be a useful tool. Type s and press Tab. You can see that R gives you suggestions of what functions and variables are available that start with the letter s, and thanks to RStudio they are formatted in this nice list. There are many suggestions here, so let’s be a bit more specific and append a q, to find what we want. If we press tab again, R will helpfully display all the available parameters for this function that we can pass an argument to.\n\n#s&lt;tab&gt;q\n#sqrt(&lt;tab&gt;)\n\nTo read the full help about sqrt, we can use the question mark, or type it directly into the help document browser.\n\n?sqrt\n\nAs you can see, sqrt() takes only one argument, x, which needs to be a numerical vector. Don’t worry too much about the fact that it says vector here; we will talk more about that later. Briefly, a numerical vector is one or more numbers. In R, every number is a vector, so you don’t have to do anything special to create a vector. More on vectors later!\nLet’s try a function that can take multiple arguments: round().\n\n#round(&lt;tab&gt;)\n?round\n\nIf we try round with a value:\n\nround(3.14159)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nHere, we’ve called round() with just one argument, 3.14159, and it has returned the value 3. That’s because the default is to round to the nearest whole number, or integer. If we want more digits we can pass an argument to the digits parameter, to specify how many decimals we want to round to.\n\nround(3.14159, digits = 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nAbove we have passed the argument 2 to the parameter digits. We can leave out the word digits since we know it comes as the second parameter, after x.\n\nround(3.14159, 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nAs you notice, we have been leaving out x from the beginning. If you provide the names for both the arguments, we can switch their order:\n\nround(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nIt’s good practice to put non-optional arguments before optional arguments, and to specify the names of all optional arguments. If you don’t, someone reading your code might have to look up the definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you’re doing."

We can also write our own functions for custom use. For example, the below chuck defines two functions which check if two scalar inputs are positive.\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function1 &lt;- function(num1, num2) {\n  if (num1 &gt; 0 & num2 &gt; 0){\n    return(\"both numbers are postive!\")\n  } else{\n    return(\"one or both numbers are not postive.\")\n  }\n}\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function1(4, 5)\n\n[1] \"both numbers are postive!\"\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function1(-4, 5)\n\n[1] \"one or both numbers are not postive.\"\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function2 &lt;- function(num1, num2) {\n  if (num1 &gt; 0){\n    if (num2 &gt; 0){\n      return(\"both numbers are postive!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function2(4, 5)\n\n[1] \"both numbers are postive!\"\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function2(-4, 5)\n\nAlthough these functions agree when both inputs are positive (i.e., they return the same output), the second function does not return a statement indicating one or both of the inputs are non-positive when this is the case. This is because we have not indicated what should be returned when the condition in one or the other if the statement in check_if_numbers_are_postive_function2 is not met.\nWe can do this as follows:\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function2 &lt;- function(num1, num2) {\n  \n  if (! num1 &gt; 0){\n    return(\"one or both numbers are not postive.\")\n  }\n  \n  if (num1 &gt; 0){\n    if (num2 &gt; 0){\n      return(\"both numbers are postive!\")\n    }\n     if (! num2 &gt; 0){\n      return(\"one or both numbers are not postive.\")\n    }\n  }\n  \n}\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function2(4, 5)\n\n[1] \"both numbers are postive!\"\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function2(-4, 5)\n\n[1] \"one or both numbers are not postive.\"\n\ncheck_if_numbers_are_postive_function2(4, -5)\n\n[1] \"one or both numbers are not postive.\"\n\n\nImportantly, these functions are not written with elegance in mind. There are better ways to check if two numbers are both positive. We encourage you to think more about how to write functions (like the above) with elegance and efficiency in mind, and how trade-offs between the two might come up.\n\n3.7.0.1 Challenge\nCan you write a function that calculates the mean of 3 numbers?\n\nmean_of_three_numbers &lt;- function(num1, num2, num3) {\n   my_sum &lt;- num1 + num2 + num3\n   my_mean &lt;- my_sum / 3\n   return(my_mean)\n}\nmean_of_three_numbers(2, 4, 6)\n\n[1] 4"

    "section": "3.8 Vectors and data types",
    "text": "3.8 Vectors and data types\nA vector is the most common data type in R, and is the workhorse of the language. A vector is composed of a series of values, which can be numbers (0, \\(\\pi\\), 72) or characters (“hello”, “I’m a ChaRaCTER”). We can assign a series of values to a vector using the c() function, which stands for concatenate. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object weight_g:\n\nweight_g &lt;- c(50, 60, 65, 82) # concatenate values into a vector\nweight_g\n\n[1] 50 60 65 82\n\n\nYou can also use the command seq to create a sequence of numbers.\n\nseq(from = 0, to = 30) # default spacing is =1\n\n [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n[26] 25 26 27 28 29 30\n\nseq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 3) # returns every third number in c(0,1,2,...,30)\n\n [1]  0  3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30\n\n\nA vector can also contain characters (in addition to numbers):\n\nanimals &lt;- c('mouse', 'rat', 'dog')\nanimals\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\n\nThe quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here and can be either single or double quotes. Without the quotes R will assume there are objects called mouse, rat and dog. As these objects don’t exist in R’s memory, there will be an error message.\nThere are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. length() tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:\n\nlength(weight_g)\n\n[1] 4\n\nlength(animals)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAn important feature of a vector is that all of the elements are the same type of data. The function class() indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:\n\nclass(weight_g)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(animals)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThe function str() provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:\n\nstr(weight_g)\n\n num [1:4] 50 60 65 82\n\nstr(animals)\n\n chr [1:3] \"mouse\" \"rat\" \"dog\"\n\n\nYou can use the c() function to add other elements to your vector:\n\nweight_g &lt;- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector\nweight_g &lt;- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector\nweight_g\n\n[1] 30 50 60 65 82 90\n\n\nIn the first line, we take the original vector weight_g, add the value 90 to the end of it, and save the result back into weight_g. Then we add the value 30 to the beginning, again saving the result back into weight_g.\nWe can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.\nAn atomic vector is the simplest R data type and it is a linear vector of a single type, e.g., all numbers. Above, we saw two of the six atomic vector types that R uses: \"character\" and \"numeric\" (or \"double\"). These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built from.\nThe other four atomic vector types are:\n\n\"logical\" for TRUE and FALSE (the boolean data type)\n\"integer\" for integer numbers (e.g., 2L, the L indicates to R that it’s an integer)\n\"complex\" to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 1 + 4i).\n\"raw\" for bitstreams. We will not discuss this type further.\n\nVectors are one of the many data structures that R uses. Other important ones are lists (list), matrices (matrix), data frames (data.frame), factors (factor) and arrays (array). In this class, we will focus on data frames, which is most commonly used one for data analyses.\n\n3.8.0.1 Challenge\nWe’ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or double), integer, and logical. What happens if we try to mix these types? Find out by using class to test these examples.\n\nnum_char &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 'a')\nnum_logical &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)\nchar_logical &lt;- c('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)\ntricky &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, '4')\n\n\n# Answer\nclass(num_char)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nclass(num_logical)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(char_logical)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nclass(tricky)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThis happens because vectors can be of only one data type. Instead of throwing an error and saying that you are trying to mix different types in the same vector, R tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a “common denominator”. A logical can be turn into 1 or 0, and a number can be turned into a string/character representation. It would be difficult to do it the other way around: would 5 be TRUE or FALSE? What number would ‘t’ be? This establishes a hierarchy for conversions/coercions, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. From the above example, we can see that the hierarchy goes logical -&gt; numeric -&gt; character, and logical can also be directly coerced into character."

We can now perform tasks iteratively:\n\n# creates vector where each number is 3 more than the previous number:\n\nx &lt;- c(0.4)\n\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n  x[i+1] &lt;- x[i] + 3 \n}\n\nx\n\n[1]  0.4  3.4  6.4  9.4 12.4 15.4\n\n# calls sqrt() function from inside loop\n\nx &lt;- c(0.4)\n\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n  x[i+1] &lt;- sqrt(x[i])\n}\n\nx\n\n[1] 0.4000000 0.6324555 0.7952707 0.8917795 0.9443408 0.9717720\n\n\nTo constrast for and while loops, consider the following:\n\nx &lt;- 0.4\ni &lt;- 1\ny &lt;- c() ### need to declare y so that values can be added in below loop\n\nwhile (x &lt;= 0.9999) {\n  y[i] &lt;- x\n  x &lt;- sqrt(x)\n  i &lt;- i + 1 # updating i so that y can be updated in next step\n}\n\n### note we could just keep track of x if we:\n### 1) use the condition x[i] &lt;= 0.9999\n### 2) calculate the next term in the sequence of sqrts using x[i+1] &lt;- sqrt(x[i])\n\ny\n\n [1] 0.4000000 0.6324555 0.7952707 0.8917795 0.9443408 0.9717720 0.9857850\n [8] 0.9928670 0.9964271 0.9982120 0.9991056 0.9995527 0.9997763 0.9998882\n\n\nThe above loop returns the sequence of square roots \\(0.4, \\sqrt{0.4}, \\sqrt{\\sqrt{0.4}}, \\dots\\). Importantly, the loop terminates when an element of this sequence is greater than 0.9999. The number of iterations until this happens is not specified. This means while loops can run for infinite time if their conditions are never violated. It is best to have checks in place to make sure this doesn’t happen!"

Groups will test predictions borne out of their hypotheses with reproducible and quantitative analysis techniques (e.g., ANOVA). If your group has an idea for statistical analyses that are beyond the scope of the course, please let us know. We are happy to support any groups who want to learn new tools, but expect that these groups are ready to learn how these tools work on their own; we hope to equip you with enough understanding to learn new things independently. Finally, the work must be original – while we may be repurposing data, we will not be simply redoing analyses. Keep in mind also that any work you do as part of this course may not be submitted for credit in another course (such as a fourth-year research project) and vice versa. While you may not submit your work for this course for credit in another course, you are welcome to publish or present your work in an academic setting.\nA note about community/citizen science websites: since the data is community-controlled, it may not always be research quality. There may be incorrect species IDs, inaccurate geolocations or time of observations, or discrepancies in protocols. When working with community science data, make sure that the data is cleaned and wrangled so that it is reliable. Quality control is a good first step when working with data, as simple errors can exist in any dataset.\n\n4.1.1 What is a hypotheses? What is a prediction?\nA hypothesis is a testable and falsifiable statement that offers a possible explanation of a phenomenon based on background knowledge, preliminary observations, or logic.\nE.g., Primary productivity is an important driver of mammal species richness.\nA prediction is based on a hypothesis. It is meant to describe what will happen in a specific situation, such as during an experiment, if the hypothesis is correct.\nE.g., If primary productivity is an important driver of mammal species richness, then more mammalian species would be found in sites with more plant biomass (proxy for primary productivity) compared with sites with less plant growth."

    "text": "4.2 Option 2: Modeling\nGroups will develop a mathematical model to answer a question in ecology and/or evolution they find interesting. There are many reasons to develop models: they help clarify assumptions, generate predictions, nullify hypotheses, provide mechanistic explanations for observed data, and help us know what kinds of data to look for. New models almost always build on existing and well-studied ones (e.g., the Lotka-Volterra model). The fact models are simplifying representations of the real world is by design! The goal of building a model is to identify the key features that make a process interesting, represent the process mathematically (and, in doing so, clarify what assumptions are being made!), characterize the behavior of the model, and from this characterization draw conclusions about how the process being modeled works. Characterization of a model can involve mathematical analysis, simulation, and confrontation with data.\nThe key steps in this project are to 1) identify an interesting question in ecology or evolution, 2) develop (and likely revise) a model to address that question, 3) characterize the behavior of the model, and 4) draw biological conclusions from the model and its characterization.\nIf you are interested in modeling, let Vicki and Mete know as soon possible!"

We have included multiple check points and small assignments throughout the semester for you to get feedback on your project ideas and ask us questions.\n\n4.5.1 Project proposal\nDue Oct 3rd, worth 4% of final grade\nGood research takes time! The purpose of the proposal is to get your group started on this process early on so that you will have sufficient time to do your project justice. This will also serve as official documentation of your project development process. Your projects will likely evolve over time, and there can be many reasons for this. For instance, as you explore your data, you might be inspired to ask different questions, or you may need to refine your hypotheses due to limitations in the data. All of these are fine, in fact, it happens all the time in real research settings.\nInclude the following information in your proposal:\n\nOption 1: your hypotheses and predictions (point form or short paragraph) and data source (short paragraph). Include a citation, a brief description of how the data was collection, and which section of the dataset you plan to use in your analysis (e.g., which columns).\nOption 2: a question you want to answer using a mathematical model (short paragraph describing the problem and the value modeling may add). Be sure to include a description of the variables that you may want to track and the kind of model you envision using.\nOption 3: same as 1, except with a description of how to simulate the data.\n\n\n\n4.5.2 Mid-project update\nDue Nov 2nd, worth 6% of final grade\nThe purpose of the mid-project update is to ensure you are on track with your projects. By now, you should have completed your exploratory data analyses, modeling, or simulation. You should have also solidified your hypotheses, predictions, and analyses plan. Essentially, you should be ready to write the Methods section of your report!\nIncluded the following information in your mid-project review:\n\nOptions 1 and 3:\n\n\nYour hypotheses and predictions (point form or short paragraph). If these differ from the ones in your proposal, explain clearly the rationale for the change.\nA detailed description of your data (a paragraph), including how the data was collected or simulated, along with any manipulation(s) you performed to get your data ready for the analysis.\nYour analysis plan (a paragraph): describe the statistical test(s) that you will use to test each prediction, including how you will validate the assumptions of each test.\n\n\nOption 2:\n\n\nA detailed description of the question you want to answer, any previous work (modeling and otherwise), the model you have built to answer this question, and your modeling assumptions.\nDetailed descriptions of the model analysis and biological interpretations of the results so far.\nYour analysis plan (a paragraph): describe additional analysis that you will do and any assumptions you would like to relax.\n\n\n\n4.5.3 Presentation\nDue Dec 5th, worth 10% of final grade\nThe presentations will be held on the last day of class during regular class hours (Dec 5th, 2-4 pm). Each presentation will be 10 minutes long, followed by 2 minutes of questions from the audience. If you cannot make it to class for your presentation, please get in touch with us to make alternative arrangements no later than Dec 1st.\n\n\n4.5.4 Report\nDue Dec 8th, worth 20% of final grade\nThis report will be styled as a journal article, with these sections:\n\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nMethods (including “Data Description” and “Data Analysis” subsections)\nResults\nDiscussion\nReferences\nSupplementary material consisting of data and code required to reproduce analysis\n\nFor your sake (and ours), we are enforcing a two page limit (single spaced, excluding figures, tables, code, references, and appendices). Please use a standard font, size 12, with regular margins. One goal of this assignment is to write clearly and concisely – it is often clarifying to put your analyses in as few words as possible.\nFor the report, you are expected to:\n\nPut your research questions in the context of existing research and literature.\nHave clear and explicit objectives, hypotheses, and/or predictions.\nAdequately describe and properly cite the data source(s) you will analyze. If your project involves modeling, describe other modeling work that is relevant.\nDescribe your analysis in sufficient detail for others to understand.\nDiscuss the interpretation of your results and their implications.\n\nThe data and code associated with your report is expected to be entirely reproducible. Your supplementary files must include the following:\n\nA description of what every column/row in your submitted data file.\nA well-annotated R script or R notebook file. We must be able to run your code once you submit the project. This lesson on best practices for writing R code is a good starting place. Also check out this coding style guide and these simple rules on how to write code that is easy to read.\n\nHermann et al. 2016 is a great example of what we expect your code to look like. Refer to their supplementary materials for examples of how to describe your data set and how to annotate your code."

    "text": "4.7 Tips on writing/presenting a research project\nWe know that students have very unique research interests and ideas, and we hope that your project encapsulates that! As instructors, we do not know everything, but we are excited to learn from you and your projects. Below are some tips that we have gathered that you may find helpful when preparing for the project presentation and writing your report.\n\nUse a title that summarizes your project/results clearly.\nDefine everything! Do not assume that we know about your question, study system, etc. For your presentations, adding some pictures will help when you are defining something.\nAfter introducing your study system, tell us clearly your hypothesis and prediction: “I hypothesize that there are more mosquitoes in the boreal forest because it is warmer. I predict this because insects have a thermal tolerance”. Then, after your methods, results, etc., remind us of your hypothesis again! For your presentation, you can even show the same slide you used for your hypothesis with a big red X or a big green checkmark. Assume we forgot and that we know nothing about the system.\nNEVER EVER USE THE WORD “prove”. Science cannot prove or disprove anything — the evidence can only support (or fail to support) how we think the world works.\nUse an appropriate font and font size. Also, use colours wisely (e.g., avoid red and blue together because of folks that are colourblind).\nA 10-minute presentation is about 10 slides (more or less depending on if you use animations). A note about animations: use “Appear”, not any of the fancy stuff. And no slide transitions!\nWe will ask questions after your presentation, but we are not trying to trick you — we just want more information. Give us your best answer, and remember that it’s okay to say “I don’t know, but I think that…” or “I can test this further by doing this”. At this point, you should know more about your projects than we do. Also, when preparing for the presentation, it useful to think about what questions listeners may have and try to answer them preemptively.\nPractice your presentation at least once with your group! It’ll get rid of any nerves you have if you already know the words you are going to say. It’ll also help you ensure that you speak louder and slower. We know you all will do great projects, and we are excited to hear about them!\n\nReading widely and often is one of the best ways to learn how to write well. Here are some papers which we think are clear, concise, and free of grammatical and logical flaws.\n\nViral zoonotic risk is homogenous among taxonomic orders of mammalian and avian reservoir hosts\nNonsystemic fungal endophytes increase survival but reduce tolerance to simulated herbivory in subarctic Festuca rubra\nEstimation of the strength of mate preference from mated pairs observed in the wild\nHumans introduce viable seeds to the Arctic on footwear\nEffects of environmental warming during early life history on libellulid odonates\nThe role of evolution in the emergence of infectious diseases\nCoevolution of parasite virulence and host mating strategies\nA rigorous measure of genome-wide genetic shuffling that takes into account crossover positions and Mendel’s second law\nThe role of divergent ecological adaptation during allopatric speciation in vertebrates"
