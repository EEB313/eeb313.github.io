## Generalized linear models: theory and examples

So far we have seen how linear models can be used to describe relationships between a response variable and predictors when the data is normally distributed or can be transformed so that this assumption is not violated. What if we were, say, interested in a *binary* response (e.g., infection status of a host with a particular parasite) and how it changes with a continuous predictor (e.g., age of the host)? In this case, one can use a special kind of linear model called *logistic regression* to estimate the additive effect of predictor(s) on the binary response. Logistic regression is a special kind of **generalized linear model**.

### GLMs: structure and assumptions

Generalized linear models describe how the mean of a response variable changes as a function of the predictors when important assumptions of the linear modeling framework (normality, constant error variance, etc.) are violated. In particular, **GLMs allow us to work with data that are not normal, whose range is restricted, or whose variance depends on the mean.** The latter might be important if, say, larger values of the response were also more variable.

A GLM models the transformed mean of a response variable $Y_i$ as a linear combination of the predictors $x_1,\dots,x_p$. The goal of using a GLM is often to estimate how the predictors (e.g., sex and previous exposure to the disease) affect the response (e.g., infection status). sThe transformation of the response is done using a "link" function $g(\cdot)$ that is specific to the distribution which used to model the data. Written out, a GLM is of the form

$$g(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \cdots \beta_p x_{pi}.$$

The link functions for the Normal, Gamma, Exponential, Poisson, and Multinomial distributions are known. In general, GLMs apply when the data are modeled using a member of the [exponential family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family). The distributions will have a mean parameter $\mu$ and, sometimes, a parameter $\tau$ which characterizes the dispersion around the mean. _GLMs are fitted using by maximizing the likelihood function that results from assuming the data arise from a distribution in the exponential family (with a mean and dispersion that depend on the predictors), using using numerical optimization methods._

### Interpretation of the effects

Notice that, in a GLM, because the mean of the response been transformed in a particular way, the coefficients must be interpreted carefully. In particular, $\beta_{j}$ is how a per-unit change in $x_{j}$ increases or decreases the _transformed_ mean $g(\mu_i)$.

### Example: logistic regression

In a previous class, we estimated the probability of death given infection for the wild boar when infected with viruses in the family _Coronaviridae_. In your current homework, you have been tasked with extending that model to all host and parasite family combinations. Excitingly, the dataset which have used includes information about the mean evolutionary isolation of all hosts that are infected with a parasite from all other hosts which are known to be infected.

Farrell and Davies tested if the mean evolutionary isolation affected the probability of death. They used a complex model to control for sampling bias and other confounding aspects of the data. We will ignore those complexities and see if, using a GLM, we can recapitulate their findings. To get started, load the `disease_distance.csv` dataset.

```{r}
disease_distance &lt;- read_csv("data/disease_distance.csv")

disease_distance %&gt;% 
  mutate(AnyDeaths = case_when(Deaths &gt; 0 ~ 1,
                               Deaths == 0 ~ 0)) -&gt; DataBern

DataBern |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(x = EvoIso, y = AnyDeaths)) + 
  geom_point()
```

These are binary data. We CANNOT use a linear model, as this assumes the data are Normal. In fact, these data are distributed according to a Bernoulli($p$) distribution. This is a member of the exponential family and the type of generalized linear model when the data are distributed in this way (i.e., are binary) is called **logistic regression**.

The mean of Bernoulli($p$) data is just $p$, and the link function for $p$ is

$$ \text{logit}(p) = \log\frac{p}{1-p}.$$

$\text{logit}(p)$ is called the *log-odds*, which can be thought of as a likelihood the response takes on the value one. In logistic regression, the log-odds ratio is modeled as a linear combination in the predictors:

$$ \text{logit}(p_i) =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{pi}.$$

Notice that increasing $x_j$ by one unit results in change $\beta_j$ to the link-transformed response.This is how the effect sizes are interpreted for GLMs such as this one.


```{r}
model &lt;- glm(AnyDeaths ~ EvoIso, 
             family = "binomial", 
             data = DataBern)
summary(model)
```

#### Challenge

How do we interpret the regression coefficient above?

#### Challenge

What are the log-odds of death if the evolutionary isolation of hosts is $EI = 200$? How much does this quantity change if the evolutionary isolation were to increase by 20 million years?

#### Visualizing the fitted model

```{r}
DataBern |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(x = EvoIso, y = AnyDeaths)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", 
              method.args = list(family = "binomial")
              )

### base R implementation

EvoIso &lt;- seq(0, 200, 0.1)
predicted_prob &lt;- predict(model, list(EvoIso = EvoIso), type = "response")

plot(DataBern$EvoIso, DataBern$AnyDeaths)
lines(EvoIso, predicted_prob)
```

### Other GLMs

Here are some common types of response variables and their corresponding distributions:

-   **Count data**: the **Poisson** distribution
-   **Over-dispersed count data** (when the count data is more spread out than "expected"): the **negative binomial** distribution
-   **Binary data** (two discrete categories): the **binomial** distribution
-   Counts of occurrences of $K$ different types: the **multinomial** distribution
-   **Times** between $r$ events: the **gamma** distribution, which is equivilent to the exponential when $r=1$

You will have the opportunity to implement such models in your homework and on the challenge assignment!

## Power analysis

When designing experiments or how best to collect data, it is best to think about the model you will fit and the kind of experiment you need to design in order to have sufficient power to detect an effect of interest. For example, if we thought that age affected the likelihood that a host dies of a disease, then we would likely fit a logistic regression-type model. By _simulating_ data from such a model, we can determine

- the minimum sample size required to reliably estimate an effect of a certain size
- the minimum sample size required to detect an effect of a certain size at a fixed significance level
- the minimum effect size that can be detected at a fixed significance level and sample size

### Example

Below is an example of a simulation in which binary disease data (death/no death; 0/1) are simulated hosts of various ages, assuming the the log-odds of disease is a linear function of age. (Notice that we assume that host lifetimes are exponentially distributed with rate parameter $\lambda = 1/10$ years. This means that hosts, in this simulation, live for an average of 10 years.) We then fit a logistic regression to this data to determine the effect of age on disease risk.

```{r}
data_generator &lt;- function(sample_size = 100, effect = 0.1){
  age &lt;- rexp(n = sample_size, rate = 1/10)
  linear_predictor &lt;- effect*age
  prob &lt;- 1/(1+exp(-linear_predictor))
  
  disease_status &lt;- c()
  
  for (i in 1:length(prob)){
  disease_status[i] &lt;- rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, prob = prob[i])
  }
  
  return(data.frame(age = age, disease_status = disease_status))
}

data &lt;- data_generator()

data %&gt;% pivot_longer(! age) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = value)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial")
              ) + labs(y = "prob. of disease (i.e., disease status =1)")

model &lt;- glm(disease_status~scale(age), family = binomial, data = data)
summary(model)
```

Next, we will write a function that performs a **power analysis**. We will use this function determine the sample size that is required so that simulating the age-disease data repeatedly we identify a significant effect of age on disease status (i.e., reject the null hypothesis) at level $\alpha = 0.01$ *at least $95\%$ of the time*.

```{r}
power_analysis_function &lt;- function(sample_size){
  
  sims &lt;- 1000
  pvalues &lt;- c()
  for (i in 1:sims){
  data &lt;- data_generator(sample_size)
  model &lt;- glm(disease_status~scale(age), family = binomial, data = data)
  pvalues[i] &lt;- summary(model)$coefficients[2,4]
  }
  
  power_estimate &lt;- length(which(pvalues &lt; 0.01))/length(pvalues)
  
  return(power_estimate)
}

sample_sizes &lt;- seq(150,200,10); power_estimates &lt;- c()

for (i in 1:length(sample_sizes)){
  power_estimates[i] &lt;- power_analysis_function(sample_size = sample_sizes[i])
}

knitr::kable(cbind(n = sample_sizes, power = power_estimates))
```

## Dealing with dependent data!

To illustrate how mixed models work and what kinds of questions we can answer using them, we will use the sexual size dimorphism data which we analyzed last class. Recall that we did NOT find a significant effect of sex on the average body size. There was no effect of the interaction between Order and sex on body size. Indeed, this matches what you saw in the homework questions where you had to visualize the data --- most of the variation in body size was _between_ orders.

In the models we built, we ignored a pretty important fact about the data: species have a common history (i.e., phylogeny). Thus, observations are not independent! This can make drawing inferences from comparative data difficult. **We will address how to deal with the non-independence of data (due to a common history of species, replication in blocks, etc.) using three approaches.**

But, first, let's download the data we will use in this section!

```{r}
SSDdata &lt;- read_csv("data/SSDinMammals.csv")
```

```{r}
mammal_length &lt;- SSDdata %&gt;%
  select(c("Order", "Scientific_Name", "lengthM", "lengthF")) %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(c(lengthM, lengthF), names_to = "sex", values_to = "length",
               names_pattern = "length(.)")

mammal_mass &lt;- SSDdata %&gt;%
  select(c("Order", "Scientific_Name", "massM", "massF")) %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(c(massM, massF), names_to = "sex", values_to = "mass",
               names_pattern = "mass(.)")

mass_nodup &lt;- mammal_mass %&gt;% 
  group_by(Scientific_Name, sex) %&gt;%
  distinct(Scientific_Name, sex, .keep_all = TRUE)

length_nodup &lt;- mammal_length %&gt;% 
  group_by(Scientific_Name, sex) %&gt;%
  distinct(Scientific_Name, sex, .keep_all = TRUE)

mammal_long &lt;- full_join(mass_nodup, length_nodup, 
                         by = join_by("Scientific_Name", "sex", "Order")) |&gt;
  drop_na()

glimpse(mammal_long)
```

### Group-by-group analyses

**One first way we can handle dependent data is to split observations into groups such that, within each group, observations are independent (or approximately so).** This is what we did last class when we fit order-specific regression coefficients of sex on body size. We saw that ALL order-specific effects had confidence intervals which overlapped zero!

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# run linear model of size on sex for EACH Order

Order_specific_models &lt;- 
  mammal_long |&gt; 
  group_by(Order) |&gt;
  do(model = tidy(lm(log(mass) ~ sex, data = .), conf.int = T))
  
# get coefficients for each Order

Order_specific_models |&gt;
  unnest() |&gt;
  select(Order, estimate)

# visualize effects, CIs, and p values

Order_specific_models |&gt;
  unnest() |&gt;
  subset(term == "sexM") |&gt;
  group_by(Order) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(y = Order, x = estimate, 
             xmin = conf.low,
             xmax = conf.high
             )
         ) +
  geom_pointrange() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2)
```

No effect of sex on body size, for any of the orders!

#### Challenge

How would you adjust the previous plot to show the estimated intercepts AND the effects of sex?

```{r}
Order_specific_models |&gt;
  unnest() |&gt;
  # subset(term == "sexM") |&gt;
  group_by(Order) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(y = Order, x = estimate, 
             xmin = conf.low,
             xmax = conf.high,
             color = term
             )
         ) +
  geom_pointrange() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2)
```

#### Challenge

How would you retrieve model fits for each Order in base R?

```{r, include=F}
for (i in 1:nrow(Order_specific_models)){
  print(summary(Order_specific_models$mod[[i]]))
}
```

#### Challenge

Adjust the plot above so that it the size of the estimates depend on the number of observations in an Order? _Hint: determine the number of observations per Order and then use the `merge()` function with the `Order_specific_models` tibble. To adjust the range of point sizes, use `scale_size()`._

```{r, include=F}
mammal_long |&gt; 
  group_by(Order) |&gt;
  summarise(number_obs = n()) |&gt;
  merge(Order_specific_models) |&gt;
  unnest() |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(y = Order, x = estimate, 
             xmin = conf.low,
             xmax = conf.high,
             color = term,
             size = number_obs
             )
         ) +
  geom_pointrange() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  scale_size(range = c(0, 2))
```

#### Pros and cons

There are several advantages to preforming a group-by-group analysis:

- **Fitting more complex models (e.g., those with random effects) can be difficult.** There may be convergence issues, and interpretation of effects and $p$-values can be tricky.
- The group-by-group analysis is **robust in the face of unbalanced data** (i.e., when there are more observations for some groups than others).
- **The conclusions from a group-by-group analysis are _conservative_.**
- The group-by-group analysis is **fairly easy to implement**.

Among the disparages to this approach are the following:

- With fewer samples per group, the analysis **may be under-powered**.
- Splitting the data into groups means there are more coefficients to estimate, and thus confidence intervals to be estimated and hypothesis tests to be performed. This means there is a greater chance that we obtain a **spurious association**.*
- It is **difficult to draw conclusions about the variance between groups.** In some applications, this is of interest. In others, it is not.

*One solution is to adjust the significant level based on the number of tests conducted. If $k$ hypotheses are tested, an [common adjustment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) is to set $\alpha = 0.05/k$.

### Controlling for phylogeny

A common reason data are dependent in biology is that **species share a common history of descent with modification.** When we assume that the observations are independent, we make implicit assumptions about the degree to which the characters at the tips of a phylogeny have underwent independent evolution. Sometimes, when species are diverged by many millions of years and traits evolve quickly, it is reasonable to ignore the phylogenetic constraints on the data. In other cases, it is essential to consider the role of phylogeny.

Several methods can control for phylogeny (if known). In fact, such methods can _use_ information in the branching pattern of species to draw inferences about the evolution of ecologically-important traits (such as body and brain size, dispersal rate, etc.). We will not discuss how to implement phylogenetic comparative methods, but it is good to know they exist and how, at a surface level, they work.

Intuition for how PCMs work is easiest to grasp when we consider a tree with $n$ species at the tips. If we know the pairwise divergence times for all species, then we can _transform_ the data so that observations are independent by looking at all _differences_ of traits. Not all differences are equally informative; if species have diverged a long time ago, there has been more time for differences to build up. PCMs account for this by specifying how the distribution of trait differences between species $i$ and $j$ depends on the time that has elapsed since these species diverged, In particular, the larger the divergence time, the greater the variance in $Y_i-Y_j$, the difference in trait values between species $i$ and $j$. A simple way to do this is to write $\sigma_{ij} = \sigma^2/T_{ij}$.^[Note: this gives rise to a likelihood function that is functionally VERY similar to the one for the linear model with constant error variance.]

### Random effects!

Another way one can account for dependent data is by including _random effects_. Random effects are often used to control for the fact that observations are clustered (e.g., trait data for species belonging to a higher taxonomic unit, measurements of plant biomass from plots of land).

#### Structure and assumptions

A common way models with random effects are formulated is as follows:

$$Y_{ij} \sim \text{Normal}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1ij} + \cdots + \beta_{p} x_{pij} + b_{0i} + b_{1i} z_{1ij} + \cdots + b_{qi} z_{qij}, \sigma_{ij}^2),$$

where $ij$ is the $i$th observation from the $j$th cluster and

$$b_{ki} \sim \text{Normal}(0,\tau_k^2).$$

This gives rise to a distribution for $Y$ which depends on the values of the random effects $b_0,\dots,b_q$. Under the hood, methods that fit models of this form numerically maximize a version of the likelihood function that results from these assumptions.

#### Challenge

In each of the following examples, which effects might be reasonably treated as fixed vs. random? Justify your answer.

1. Suppose we are working with rodents that have been infected with an evolved strain of the parasite that causes malaria. Some rodents have been treated with a prospective vaccine and others sham-vaccinated. We are interested if a proxy for virulence (e.g., density of infected red blood cells) depends on vaccination status.

2. Suppose we conduct the same experiment, except rodents are caged are sets of four.

3. Suppose we measure the time between sightings of a raccoon in a Toronto neighborhood using six camera traps (strategically placed in the neighborhood). We do this for year, and want to ask if mean daily temperature predicts the frequency of raccoon occurrence.

4. Suppose that, every year, we go to the Amazon and measure the number of bird calls that come from $n=30$ trees. Assume that the trees are far enough apart we can treat them as independent. We measure the number of birds in a tree, characteristics of the tree (cover, height, width, age), the year in which a measurement was done, and the mean temperature that year. We want to know if tree cover affects the frequency of bird calls, and if it interacts with temperature.

#### Using `lme4` to fit random and mixed effect models

We will start by fitting a model of log body size on log length where the intercept is random depending on the Order. Based on a quick visualization of the data, such a model may be appropriate.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mammal_long, aes(y = log(mass), 
                               x = log(length)
                               )
       ) + 
    geom_point(aes(color = Order), size = 3) -&gt; p

p 
```

```{r, include=F}
# no Order-dependence:
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# intercept AND slope fixed and specific to the Order:
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + facet_wrap(~Order) 
```

To fit regress the response on a set of fixed effects with random _intercepts_ that depends the values assumed by a random effect `x`, we call `lmer` and write a linear model with `(1|x)`.

```{r}
## random intercept for Order

model &lt;- lmer(formula = log(mass) ~ log(length) + (1|Order), data = mammal_long)
summary(model)

fixef(model)
ranef(model)
```

From top to bottom, the output is telling us that the model was fit using a method called REML (restricted maximum likelihood). It returns information about the residuals, random effects, and fixed effects. The output also tells us about the **estimated variance for the random effects** in the model. Here, the variance associated with Order is 4.256. The variance explained by Order is 4.256/(4.256+0.847) _after controlling for the fixed effects_. Note the denominator here is the total variance, including from the residuals. As usual, we also have information about the fixed effects.

To visualize the model, we can predict the overall and Order-specific relationship of log mass on log length for all of the Orders represented in the data.

```{r}
mammal_long |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; select(mass, length, Order) |&gt; 
  mutate(fit.m = predict(model, re.form = NA), # does not include random effects
         fit.c = predict(model, re.form = NULL) # includes random effects
         ) -&gt;
  predicted_values

predicted_values |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(x = log(length), y = log(mass), color = Order)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line(inherit.aes = F, aes(x = log(length), y = fit.c, color = Order), size = 1) +
  geom_line(inherit.aes = F, aes(x = log(length), y = fit.m), color = "black", size = 2)
```

The thick black line corresponds to the fitted values associated with the fixed-effect component of the model. The colored lines correspond to the fitted values estimated for each Order. 

Perhaps a model with Order-specific random intercepts AND slopes would be better. We fit this model using the code below. The key difference in syntax is that we write `(1+fixed effect|random effect)` to indicate that the random effect has an effect on both the intercept _and_ slope of the response on the fixed effect.

```{r}
## random intercept and slope for Order

model2 &lt;- lmer(formula = log(mass) ~ log(length) + (1+log(length)|Order), data = mammal_long)
summary(model2)

fixef(model2)
ranef(model2)
```

```{r}
mammal_long |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; select(mass, length, Order) |&gt; 
  mutate(fit.m = predict(model2, re.form = NA),
         fit.c = predict(model2, re.form = NULL)
         ) -&gt;
  predicted_values

predicted_values |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(x = log(length), y = log(mass), color = Order)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line(inherit.aes = F, aes(x = log(length), y = fit.c, color = Order), size = 1) +
  geom_line(inherit.aes = F, aes(x = log(length), y = fit.m), color = "black", size = 2)
```

Why does this look like a mess? As stated above, **mixed models do not work well when datasets are unbalanced.** Indeed, the number of observations in the different Orders are quite variable.

#### Challenge

Regress log body size on sex with Order as a random effect that affects the intercept AND slope of the sex-size relationship.

```{r, include=F}
Model &lt;- lmer(log(mass) ~ sex + (1+sex|Order), mammal_long)

mammal_long |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; select(Scientific_Name, mass, sex, Order) |&gt; 
  mutate(fit.m = predict(Model, re.form = NA),
         fit.c = predict(Model, re.form = NULL)
         ) -&gt;
  predicted_values

predicted_values |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = log(mass))) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Scientific_Name), color = "lightgrey") +
  geom_point(color = "lightgrey", size = 2) +
  geom_point(inherit.aes = F, aes(x = sex, y = fit.c, color = Order), size = 3) +
  geom_line(inherit.aes = F, aes(x = sex, y = fit.c, color = Order, group = Order), size = 2) +
  geom_point(inherit.aes = F, aes(x = sex, y = fit.m), color = "black", size = 3) +
  geom_line(inherit.aes = F, aes(x = sex, y = fit.m, group = ""), color = "black", size = 3) +

<p>The course project is a self-directed group project that may take a couple forms (data analysis, modelling, or simulation study), but will make use of technical and scientific tools that we have learned in class. Aside from a couple constraints, groups are free to do their projects on any subject within ecology and evolution that they find interesting. The forms the project may take are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A hypothesis-driven analysis of existing ecological or evolutionary data.</li>
<li>Development and analysis of a mathematical model.</li>
<li>Simulate data and analyze it using appropriate tools.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to utilize conventional data science collaboration tools, students are required to use <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> for code-sharing, project management, and individual contributions. All sections of the project will be submitted via Github, not Quercus. Everyone in your group will need to make a GitHub account prior to the first project deadline. We will cover the basics of GitHub in advance so that you are prepared to use it.</p>
<section id="option-1-hypothesis-driven-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-1-hypothesis-driven-project">Option 1: Hypothesis-driven project</h2>
<p>Groups will formulate their own hypotheses based on their interests within ecology and evolution. Groups will test predictions borne out of their hypotheses with reproducible and quantitative analysis techniques (e.g., ANOVA). If your group has an idea for statistical analyses that are beyond the scope of the course, please let us know. We are happy to support any groups who want to learn new tools, but expect that these groups are ready to learn how these tools work on their own; we hope to equip you with enough understanding to learn new things independently. Finally, the work must be original – while we may be repurposing data, we will not be simply redoing analyses. Keep in mind also that any work you do as part of this course may not be submitted for credit in another course (such as a fourth-year research project) and vice versa. While you may not submit your work for this course for credit in another course, you are welcome to publish or present your work in an academic setting. (In fact, if you do so, please let us know!)</p>
<p>A note about community/citizen science websites: since the data is community-controlled, it may not always be research quality. There may be incorrect species IDs, inaccurate geolocations or time of observations, or discrepancies in protocols. When working with community science data, make sure that the data is cleaned and wrangled so that it is reliable. Quality control is a good first step when working with data, as simple errors can exist in any dataset.</p>

There are many reasons to develop models: they help clarify assumptions, generate predictions, nullify hypotheses, provide mechanistic explanations for observed data, and help us know <em>what kinds of data</em> to look for. New models almost always build on existing and well-studied ones (e.g., the Lotka-Volterra model). The fact models are simplifying representations of the real world is by design! The goal of building a model is to identify the key features that make a process interesting, represent the process mathematically (and, in doing so, clarify what assumptions are being made!), characterize the behaviour of the model, and from this characterization draw conclusions about how the process being modelled works. Characterization of a model can involve mathematical analysis, simulation, and confrontation with data.</p>
<p>The key steps in this project are to 1) identify an interesting question in ecology or evolution, 2) develop (and likely revise) a model to address that question, 3) characterize the behaviour of the model, and 4) draw biological conclusions from the model and its characterization.</p>

<section id="option-3-simulation-study" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-3-simulation-study">Option 3: Simulation study</h2>
<p>Similar to Option 1, groups that do a simulation study will formulate hypotheses and use reproducible and quantitative analysis techniques to test predictions borne out of those hypotheses. The difference is that students will <em>simulate</em> their own data, instead of using an existing dataset. One reason to do a simulation study is to see what kind of data would be needed to test a hypothesis in the field, e.g., how much data would be needed to find a significant association between response and predictor variables.</p>

<h1>Project timeline and deliverables</h1>
<p>As instructors, we are here to help your group work towards a project idea that you are excited about – and to help you execute that idea to the fullest! We have included multiple check points and small assignments throughout the semester for you to find the right group-mates, get feedback on your project ideas, ask us question, and make sure the analysis is on-track. By September 17, you will need to provide us with a short description of your interests in ecology and evolution. September 26 will be devoted to identifying a group and begin the project proposal. All classes after October 24 will be devoted to working on projects with your groups. We (Mete and Zoë) will be around during those times provide support, if needed.</p>
<section id="individual-interest-description" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-interest-description">Individual interest description</h2>
<p><em>Due Sept 12th</em>, worth 1% of final grade</p>
<p>To make sure you pair up with group mates who share common interests, we ask that you write a short (4-5 sentences) description of your interests in ecology and evolution. Please do so in RStudio by creating an .Rmd file and knitting it into a pdf.</p>
<p>Here are some discussion questions to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a scientific paper or popular science article you read (or a podcast you listened to) recently that you found interesting (how microbial communities differ among environments, frequency of herbicide resistance alleles in weed populations, bird species richness in regions that have experienced climatic shifts, understanding the relationship between longevity and traits like body size in mice…)?</li>
<li>What is your favourite EEB course so far? Why did you like it?</li>
<li>Thinking about EEB professors, was there anyone whose work you are particularly interested in?</li>
<li>Browse through some recent issues of broad scope EEB journals such as <em>Trends in Ecology and Evolution</em> and <em>Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics</em>. Any articles catching your eyes?</li>
<li>Check out <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.12025">this paper</a>. Any of those questions spark your interest?</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project-proposal">Project proposal</h2>
<p><em>Due Oct 17rd</em>, worth 3% of final grade</p>
<p>Good research takes time! The purpose of the proposal is to get your group started on this process early on so that you will have sufficient time to do your project justice. This will also serve as official documentation of your project development process. Your projects will likely evolve over time, and there can be many reasons for this. For instance, as you explore your data, you might be inspired to ask different questions, or you may need to refine your hypotheses due to limitations in the data.</p>
<p>Include the following information in your proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: your hypotheses and predictions (point form or short paragraph) and data source (short paragraph). Include a citation, a brief description of how the data was collection, and which section of the dataset you plan to use in your analysis (e.g., which columns).</li>
<li>Option 2: a question you want to answer using a mathematical model (short paragraph describing the problem and the value modeling may add). Be sure to include a description of the variables that you may want to track and the kind of model you envision using.</li>
<li>Option 3: same as 1, except with a description of how to simulate the data.</li>

<h1>Tips on writing/presenting a research project</h1>
<p>We know that students have very unique research interests and ideas, and we hope that your project encapsulates that! As instructors, we do not know everything, but we are excited to learn from you and your projects. Below are some tips that we have gathered that you may find helpful when preparing for the project presentation and writing your report.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use a title that summarizes your project/results clearly.</li>
<li>Define everything! Do not assume that we know about your question, study system, etc. For your presentations, adding some pictures will help when you are defining something.</li>
<li>After introducing your study system, tell us clearly your hypothesis and prediction: “I hypothesize that there are more mosquitoes in the boreal forest because it is warmer. I predict this because insects have a thermal tolerance”. Then, after your methods, results, etc., remind us of your hypothesis again! For your presentation, you can even show the same slide you used for your hypothesis with a big red X or a big green checkmark. Assume we forgot and that we know nothing about the system.</li>
<li>NEVER USE THE WORD “prove”. Science cannot prove or disprove anything — the evidence can only support (or fail to support) how we think the world works.</li>
<li>Use an appropriate font and font size. Also, use colours wisely (e.g., avoid red and blue together because of folks that are colourblind).</li>
<li>A 10-minute presentation is about 10 slides (more or less depending on if you use animations). A note about animations: use “Appear”, not any of the fancy stuff. And no slide transitions!</li>
<li>We will ask questions after your presentation, but we are not trying to trick you — we just want more information. Give us your best answer, and remember that it’s okay to say “I don’t know, but I think that…” or “I can test this further by doing this”. At this point, you should know more about your projects than we do. Also, when preparing for the presentation, it useful to think about what questions listeners may have and try to answer them preemptively.</li>
<li>Practice your presentation at least once with your group! It’ll get rid of any nerves you have if you already know the words you are going to say. It’ll also help you ensure that you speak louder and slower. We know you all will do great projects, and we are excited to hear about them!</li>
</ol>
<p>Reading widely and often is one of the best ways to learn how to write well. Here are some papers which we think are clear, concise, and free of grammatical and logical flaws.</p>
