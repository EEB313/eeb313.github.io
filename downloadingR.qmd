## Introduction {-}

This course makes extensive use of R and RStudio. If you have any
issues installing R or RStudio, let's resolve them in advance so that
you can make the most of our time together! As you follow these
instructions, don't worry if you don't understand exactly what is going
on - we will go through it all again during the first lecture! The
goal here is to ensure that your computer is set up and ready for
action. **If you can't complete these steps, please email Vicki and Mete
as soon as possible.**

## Tech Requirements {-}

First, make sure that your personal computer meets meets these requirements: 

- 1024Ã—768 screen resolution,
- 1.5GHz CPU,
- 2GB RAM,
- 10GB free disk space,
- a recent version of Windows, Mac OS, or Linux is installed.

Next, check that a robust internet browser such as Firefox, Safari or Google is installed. 
(Internet Explorer will not work.) Finally, make that a PDF viewer 
(e.g., Adobe Acrobat, Preview) is installed. It is fine if no PDF viewer
is installed if you can view PDFs on your web browser.

## Download R and RStudio {-}

1. **Download R**, a free software environment for statistical computing and
graphics from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/), the Comprehensive R
Archive Network. We recommend you install a precompiled binary
distribution for your operating system -- use the links up at the top of
the CRAN page!

Note: MacBook users with an Apple Silicon chip (e.g., M1 or M2) should
install the "arm64" version of R, while MacBook users with an Intel chip
should install the regular (64-bit) version of R. You can check your
laptop's hardware specifications by clicking the Apple icon (top left
corner) `\> About This Mac`.

2. **Install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**, a graphical 
user interface (GUI) for R. Click the link under "2: Install RStudio". RStudio
comes with a text editor, so there is no immediate need to install a
separate stand-alone editor.

If R is already installed, **ensure that the R version is 4.0 or
higher.** You can do this by opening RStudio, where you should see a
multi-section window like below. Locate the quadrant named "Console",
and put your cursor at the start of the prompt indicated by the `>` symbol
and where the red arrow is pointing. Type or copy `sessionInfo()` - make
sure that only the I at the start of Info is capitalized and you are
including the round brackets. Press enter to run this command and R
should return an output to you. The first line shows what version of R is installed.
Ensure that the R version installed is at least 4.0.

## Download Packages {-}

### TinyTex

There is one package we have to install first before we can create PDF
reports, which will be necessary for assignments and the project. Copy
and paste into the console (where the `\>` symbol is) the two lines of
code below to install a package called `tinytex`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex") 
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### All packages

1.  Copy and paste the below code into your console.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "knitr", "datasauRus", "car",
                   "lme4", "lmerTest", "ggalt", "MuMIn", "sjmisc",
                   "lsmeans", "ggfortify", "vegan"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

During installation, if you ever get the below message, click "No".

If you get the message "Do you want to install from
sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)" in the Console, type
"Yes" and press enter.

2. **Check that these packages have been installed correctly**. To do this,
go to the bottom right pane and click the tab for "Packages". If you can search
for and find the below packages, then they have been installed! They do
not need to be checked off. Alternatively, go to the Console and type `library(lme4)` to
verify that the `lme4` package is installed. An error along the lines "there is no package called
lme4" will be returned if the package is not installed.
