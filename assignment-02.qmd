# Assignment 02

1.  Plotting (1 mark)

Run the code below to create a categorical variable of the `activ`
column. This will make dplyr recognize that there are only two
levels of activity (0 and 1), rather than a continuous range 0-1,
which will facilitate plotting.

``` {r eval=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
beaver1_f <- beaver1 %>%
  mutate(factor_activ = factor(activ))
```

a.  In the previous assignment, we saw that the beaver's body
  temperature was the highest when the beaver was outside the
  retreat. However, we did not explore the distribution of
  temperatures for the active and inactive conditions. Create a
  histogram with the temperature on the x-axis and color the bins
  corresponding to the activity variable. (0.25 marks)
  
  _Hint: You need to use the `fill` parameter rather than `color`._

b.  We already know that the beaver's body temperature is correlated
  with whether it is outside the retreat or not. However, we did
  not control for the time of day, maybe the beaver's temperature
  is even better predicted by knowing what time of day it is. To
  satisfactorily answer this question, we should perform a
  regression analysis, but we can easily get a good overview by
  plotting the data. Make a scatter plot with the time of day on
  the x-axis and the body temperature on the y-axis. Color the
  scatter points according the beaver's activity level and
  separate the measurements into one plot per day. (0.75 marks)
  
  _Hint: To separate measurements per day, you could use `filter()` and two chunks of code, but try the more efficient way of facetting into subplots, which we talked about in the lecture._


2.  Read in and pre-process data (1 mark)

Ok, that's enough about beaver body temperatures. Now you will apply
your data wrangling skills on the yearly change in biomass of plants
in the [beautiful Abisko national park in northern
Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abisko_National_Park). We have
preprocessed this data and made [it available as a csv-file via this
link](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/data/plant-biomass-preprocess.csv).
You can find the original data and a short readme on
[figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Time_Series_of_plant_biomass_during_1998-2013/4149648)
and [dryad](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.38s21).
The original study[^1] is available un an open access license.
Reading through the readme on figshare, and the study abstract will
increase your understanding for working with the data.

a.  Read the data directly from the provided URL, into a variable
  called `plant_biomass` and display the first six rows. (0.25
  mark)

b.  Convert the Latin column names into their common English names:
  lingonberry, bilberry, bog bilberry, dwarf birch, crowberry, and
  wavy hair grass. After this, display all column names. (0.25 marks)
  
  _Hint: Search online to find out which Latin and English names pair up._ 

c.  This is a wide data frame (species make up the column names). A
  long format is easier to analyze, so gather the species names
  into one column (`species`) and the measurement values into
  another column (`biomass`). Keep all other columns. Assign it to the variable
  `plant_long`. (0.5 marks)


3.  Data exploration (5 marks)

Now that our data is in a tidy format, we can start exploring it!

a.  What is the average biomass in g/m^2^ for all observations in
  the study? (0.25 marks)

b.  How does the average biomass compare between the grazed control
  sites and those that were protected from herbivores? (0.25
  marks)

c.  Display a table of the average plant biomass for each year.
  (0.25 marks)

d.  What is the mean plant biomass per year for the `grazedcontrol`
  and `rodentexclosure` groups (spread these variables as separate
  columns in a table)? (0.5 marks)

e.  Compare the biomass for `grazedcontrol` with that of
  `rodentexclosure` graphically in a line plot. What could explain
  the big dip in biomass year 2012? (0.75 marks)
  
  _Hint: The published study might be able to help with the second question..._ 

f.  Check whether there is an equal number of observations per
  species. (0.25 marks)

g.  Compare the yearly change in biomass for each species in a
  lineplot. (0.5 marks)

h.  From the previous two questions, we found that the biomass is
  higher in the sites with rodent exclosures (especially in recent
  years), and that the crowberry is the dominant species. Notice
  how the lines for `rodentexclosure` and `crowberry` are of
  similar shape. Coincidence? Let's find out! Use a facetted line
  plot to explore whether all plant species are impacted equally
  by grazing. (0.75 mark)

i.  The habitat could also be affecting the biomass of different
  species. Explore this graphically. (0.75 marks)

k.  It looks like both habitat and treatment have an effect on most
  of the species! Let's dissect the data further by visualizing
  the effect of both the habitat and treatment on each species by
  facetting the plot accordingly. (0.75 mark)
  
  _Hint: This is a hard one! You may want to explore R's documentation for ggplot's `facet_grid`_ 


4.  Create a new column that represents the square of the biomass.
Display the three largest `squared_biomass` observations in
descending order. Only include the columns `year`, `squared_biomass`
and `species` and only observations between the years 2003 and 2008
from the forest habitat. 

_Hint: Break this down into single criteria and add one at a time. You will be able to obtain the desired result with five operations_ (1 mark)
