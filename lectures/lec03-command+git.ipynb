        "\n",
        "Increasing amounts of data in biology (especially genomic data stored in databases like the UK Biobank and GenBank) are transforming the field. These data have allowed us to ask and answer questions that would otherwise be impossible to address, and have motivated extensive cross-talk between biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics. **To analyze large-scale datasets in a way that is efficient, robust, reproducible, and scale-able, researchers turn to the command line. The command line interface allows researches to pass commands to the _shell_.** \n",
        "\n",
        "Some advantages of working are the commend line are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Efficient **parallelization**: where it would not be possible to preform certain calculations due to time and memory limitations, the command line allows us to interface with computing clusters which can run many calculations or processes simultaneously. For example, efficient parallelization can allow a user to run many simulations of a model (each run corresponding to a different combination of parameter values)  simultaneously. This can cut run times from months to seconds.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Control over data**: the command line allows users to view, parse, transform, and transfer large files (such as genome sequences) efficiently. Such control is simply not possible with a GUI like RStudio.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Automation, reproducibility, and computational ease**: shell commands automate tasks which would otherwise be 1) computationally expensive, 2) error-prone, and 3) emotionally taxing.^[Trust us on this!] Shell commands can be scripted, shared, version-controlled, and made to run at certain times. (For example, shell scripts designed to scrape the web for data are often made to run during off-peak hours.) Because the command line makes automating complex tasks possible, software used to analyze large data is often written for use on the command line, with no equivalent in languages like R and Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "All that said, shell commands appear quite scary. **Indeed, the command line is unforgiving--cryptic error messages abound when incorrect commands are entered. One can do serious damage without understanding the basis of the shell. The goal of this lecture is to provide you all with knowledge of 1) the logic of the command line, 2) important shell commands, 3) how to run R scripts from the command line, and 4) how to use the command line to interface with GitHub.** The first half of the lecture will focus on the shell, and the second half on Git.\n",

        "### Logic of the command line\n",
        "\n",
        "The command line interface takes commands of the following form:\n",

        "command param1 param2 param3 … paramN\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "where `param1`, `param2`, $\\dots,$ and `paramN` are parameters provided by the user. This is a simplification, but one can get by thinking of commands as having this form, with the command line interpreter providing an interface between what is entered and the machine. Commands can range in what they do (navigation between directories, editing of files and of file permissions, etc.) but will not do what they are intended to if the relevant parameters are not specified, or if files which are called by the command are not accessible.\n",

For example, if you wanted to identify all of the transposable elements (\"selfish genes\" that make copies of themselves in their host genomes) in a genome, you'd want to run something like [EDTA](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA) but it does not offer a graphical interface. If you had a sequence that you knew was associated with herbicide resistance, you could use [NCBI's BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to compare your nucleotide or protein sequence against a large database to find regions of similarity in order to determine the potential functional role of the region or if the region is shared among similar species. The has an online graphical interface but is also available to use via the command line. The command line provides some additional functionality, such as the time-saving option of performing searches in parallel.\n",

        "#### Step 1: Understand the software\n",
        "\n",
        "Your first step to running something is always going to be reading documentation. You need to understand what the software tool is actually doing and whether that methods it uses is appropriate for your data. \n",
        "\n",
        "The *inputs* and *outputs* of a programme are an important starting place. [BLAST's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK569856/) required inputs are `-query`, a \"query sequence\" (what you're looking for), and `-db`, a \"database\" (where you're hoping to find a match). \n",
        "Ideally, you've read the paper associated with the software's creation, you've understood all of the arguments that can be passed to the software, and, most importantly, you understand the software's weaknesses and strengths with regards to your particular type of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the most important step for analysing your data. Getting the software running can be tricky and often more time-consuming than this step, but understanding what's happening to your data is the most important thing you're going to do. \n",

        "One way to interact with help documentation is to use `-h` or `-help`. Many software tools will display their documentation after such an argument.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **repository** (short form: repo):  a storage area for a project containing all the files for the project and the history of all the changes made to those files\n",
        "\n",
        "- **local copy**: the version of file stored on your own computer\n",
        "\n",
        "- **remote copy**: the version of a file stored outside of your own computer, for example stored on an external server, perhaps at GitHub. Remotes are referenced by nicknames, e.g., origin or upstream.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **branch**: a named series of commits. The default branch that you download is usually called gh-pages or main. Creating a new branch makes a parallel version of a repository where changes can be made that affect the new branch only and not the original (base) version of the repository. New branches are often used to test changes or new ideas, which can later be merged with the base branch. Moving from one branch to another is called checking out a new branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **fork** (GitHub-specific term): to copy a repository from another user and store it under your own GitHub account. Can also refer to the copied repo itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **gh-pages** (GitHub-specific term): stands for \"GitHub Pages\". This is often the default branch in repositories. Branches called gh-pages can be published as webpages hosted by GitHub.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **origin**: the main remote repository you want to download files from or compare local changes you have made to. When you've forked a repository, your origin is your new copy of the repository in your account.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **upstream**: the original repository you made your fork from. Both origin and upstream are remote repositories.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **commit**: to save changes in your working directory to your local repository\n",
        "\n",
        "- **push**: send committed changes you have made on your local computer to a remote repository. For a change to show up on GitHub, the committed changes must be pushed from your computer to the remote repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **pull**: download changes from a remote repository to your local version of the same repository. This is useful when other people have made changes to a shared project, and you want to download (pull) the changes from the shared remote repository to your own computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **pull request** (GitHub-specific term, abbreviated as \"PR\"): send proposed changes from a specific version of a repository back to the main version of a repository to be considered for incorporation by the people maintaining the repository (the maintainers). You are requesting that the maintainers pull your changes into their repository.\n",
