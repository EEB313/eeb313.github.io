This land has historically been and still is the home of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit River.  \n\nThere is a [First Nations House](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/first-nations-house/) for Indigenous Student Services on campus. Please refer to their web page for more resources and information about honouring our land and their services for students.  \n\n## Diversity and inclusion statement\n\nAs students, you all have something unique and special to offer to science. It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be recognized as a resource, strength, and benefit. \n\nDiversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, national origin, language, cultural heritage, physical ability, neurodiversity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and socio-economic class. Each of these varied, and often intersecting, identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives we bring to this class, to this department, and to the greater EEB community. We will work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. \n\nWe expect that everybody in this class will respect each other, and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other people's perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from their own. Racist, sexist, colonialist, homophobic, transphobic, and other abusive and discriminatory behavior and language will not be tolerated in this class and will result in disciplinary action, such as removal from class session or revocation of group working privileges. Please consult the [University of Toronto Code of Student Conduct](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-student-conduct-december-13-2019) for details on unacceptable conduct and possible sanctions.\n\nPlease let us know if something said or done in this class, by either a member of the teaching team or other students, is particularly troubling or causes discomfort or offense. While our intention may not be to cause discomfort or offense, the impact of what happens throughout the course is not to be ignored and is something that we consider to be very important and deserving of attention. If and when this occurs, there are several ways to alleviate some of the discomfort or hurt you may experience:\n\n* Discuss the situation privately with a member of the teaching team. We are always open to listening to students' experiences, and want to work with students to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue.\n* Notify us of the issue through another source such as a trusted faculty member or a peer. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing the issue directly with us, we encourage you to seek out another, more comfortable avenue to address the issue.\n* Contact the [Anti-Racism and Cultural Diversity Office](https://antiracism.utoronto.ca/) to report an incident and receive complaint resolution support, which may include consultations and referrals.\n\nWe acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a community that increasingly embraces these core values. Your suggestions and feedback are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. \n\n## Wellness statement\n\nWe on the teaching team value your health and wellness. In order to succeed in this class, in university, and beyond, you must balance your work with rest, exercise, and attention to your mental and physical health. **Working until exhaustion is NOT a badge of honor**. If you are finding it difficult to balance your health and well-being with your work in this class, please do not hesitate to let us know. We are happy to help connect you with resources and services on campus and also to make accommodations to our course plan as needed. Our inboxes are always open, and we are also available for virtual chats by appointment. You have our support, and we believe in you.\n\n## Course Overview\n\nThis course covers statistical and data analysis, reproducible quantitative methods, and scientific computing in R to answer questions in ecology and evolutionary biology.

Your final course mark will be the sum of your assignment scores, which will be translated to a letter grade according to the [official grading scale](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/teaching/teaching-learning-resources/academic-handbook#FinalMarks) of the Faculty of Arts and Science.\n\nAssignments will be distributed and submitted in the R Markdown format via Quercus. Assignments will typically be handed out on Thursdays after class and are due at 8:00 PM on the following Thursday. \n\nThe Challenge Assignment is equivalent to a take home exam. The format will be the same as the other assignments, but this assignment is designed challenge you to go a little beyond what was taught in class. It will be distributed on 9:00 AM on Nov 11, and it will be due 11:59 PM on Nov 15. Students are welcome to work in a group on this assignment, but each student must submit their own original work. No extensions will be granted on this assignment except under the same extra-ordinary circumstances akin to those under which an exam might be deferred. We only expect you to do your best!\n\n_Per our stance on supporting student's mental health, we are happy to accommodate a 72-hour extension for *one* of the assignments, no questions asked. Otherwise, except under extenuating circumstances, there will be a penalty of 5% per day (including weekends) for all late submissions. If you foresee needing an extension, please email Zoë AND Mete as soon as possible. This policy does not apply to the Challenge Assignment, Presentation, or Final Report._\n\n**All submissions to Quercus/GitHub must be submitted as PDFs (i.e., knitted).**\n\n## Improving your writing skills\n\nEffective communication is crucial in science. The University of Toronto provides [services](http://writing.utoronto.ca/) to help you improve your writing, from general advices on effective writing to writing centers and writing courses. The Faculty of Arts & Science also offers an English Language Learning (ELL) program, which provides free individualized instruction in English skills. Take advantage of these!\n\n## Academic integrity\n\nYou should be aware of the [University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019). Also see [How Not to Plagiarize](http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/). Notably, it is NOT appropriate to use large sections from internet sources, and inserting a few words here and there does not make it an original piece of writing. Be careful in using internet sources -- most online material are not reviewed and there are many errors out there. Make sure you read material from many sources (published, peer-reviewed, trusted internet sources) and that you write an original text using this information. Always cite your sources. In case of doubt about plagiarism, talk to your instructors and TAs. Please make sure that what you submit for the final project does not overlap with what you submit for other classes, such as the 4^th^-year research project. \n\n### On the use of generative AI\n\nWe recognize that students use generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT. If you use such tools in this course, we ask that you let us know. Given the limitations of these tools, and the fact we will be available to support your learning without the use of AI, we would recommend that you be very cautious when using generative AI. On any submissions where, e.g., ChatGPT, is used please indicate in the answer to the question how the tool was used.\n\n## FAS student engagement programs\n\nThere are a few programs on campus aimed at increasing student engagement with their coursework and keeping them socially connected. [Recognized Study Groups](https://sidneysmithcommons.artsci.utoronto.ca/recognized-study-groups/) are voluntary, peer-led study groups of up to 8 students enrolled in the same course. [Meet to Complete](https://sidneysmithcommons.artsci.utoronto.ca/meet-to-complete/) are online drop-in study sessions for A&S undergrads. These are worth checking out if you are interested in participating in a study group.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
