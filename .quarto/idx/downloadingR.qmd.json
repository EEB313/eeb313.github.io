If you have any\nissues installing R or RStudio, let's resolve them in advance so that\nyou can make the most of our time together! As you follow these\ninstructions, don't worry if you don't understand exactly what is going\non - we will go through it all again during the first lecture! The\ngoal here is to ensure that your computer is set up and ready for\naction. **If you can't complete these steps, please email Vicki and Mete\nas soon as possible.**\n\n## Tech Requirements {-}\n\nFirst, make sure that your personal computer meets meets these requirements: \n\n- 1024Ã—768 screen resolution,\n- 1.5GHz CPU,\n- 2GB RAM,\n- 10GB free disk space,\n- a recent version of Windows, Mac OS, or Linux is installed.\n\nNext, check that a robust internet browser such as Firefox, Safari or Google is installed. \n(Internet Explorer will not work.) Finally, make that a PDF viewer \n(e.g., Adobe Acrobat, Preview) is installed. It is fine if no PDF viewer\nis installed if you can view PDFs on your web browser.\n\n## Download R and RStudio {-}\n\n1. **Download R**, a free software environment for statistical computing and\ngraphics from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/), the Comprehensive R\nArchive Network. We recommend you install a precompiled binary\ndistribution for your operating system -- use the links up at the top of\nthe CRAN page!\n\nNote: MacBook users with an Apple Silicon chip (e.g., M1 or M2) should\ninstall the \"arm64\" version of R, while MacBook users with an Intel chip\nshould install the regular (64-bit) version of R. You can check your\nlaptop's hardware specifications by clicking the Apple icon (top left\ncorner) `\\> About This Mac`.\n\n2. **Install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**, a graphical \nuser interface (GUI) for R. Click the link under \"2: Install RStudio\". RStudio\ncomes with a text editor, so there is no immediate need to install a\nseparate stand-alone editor.\n\nIf R is already installed, **ensure that the R version is 4.0 or\nhigher.** You can do this by opening RStudio, where you should see a\nmulti-section window like below. Locate the quadrant named \"Console\",\nand put your cursor at the start of the prompt indicated by the `>` symbol\nand where the red arrow is pointing. Type or copy `sessionInfo()` - make\nsure that only the I at the start of Info is capitalized and you are\nincluding the round brackets. Press enter to run this command and R\nshould return an output to you. The first line shows what version of R is installed.\nEnsure that the R version installed is at least 4.0.\n\n![](figures/rconsole.png){width=100%}\n\n## Download Packages {-}\n\n### TinyTex\n\nThere is one package we have to install first before we can create PDF\nreports, which will be necessary for assignments and the project. Copy\nand paste into the console (where the `\\>` symbol is) the two lines of\ncode below to install a package called `tinytex`.\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\") \ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\n\n### All packages\n\n1.  Copy and paste the below code into your console.\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"here\", \"knitr\", \"datasauRus\", \"car\",\n                   \"lme4\", \"lmerTest\", \"ggalt\", \"MuMIn\", \"sjmisc\",\n                   \"lsmeans\", \"ggfortify\", \"vegan\"), dependencies = TRUE)\n```\n\nDuring installation, if you ever get the below message, click \"No\". \n\n![](figures/restartr.png){width=30%}\n\nIf you get the message \"Do you want to install from\nsources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)\" in the Console, type\n\"Yes\" and press enter.\n\n2. **Check that these packages have been installed correctly**. To do this,\ngo to the bottom right pane and click the tab for \"Packages\". If you can search\nfor and find the below packages, then they have been installed! They do\nnot need to be checked off. Alternatively, go to the Console and type `library(lme4)` to\nverify that the `lme4` package is installed. An error along the lines \"there is no package called\nlme4\" will be returned if the package is not installed.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"downloadingR.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
